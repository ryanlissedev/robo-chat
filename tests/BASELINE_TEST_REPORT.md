4. **Flaky Test Rate:** <1% (currently ~20%)

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Stabilization Focus:** Fix critical failing tests first
2. **Mock Cleanup:** Standardize and repair mock configurations  
3. **Dependency Resolution:** Resolve React version conflicts
4. **Basic E2E Setup:** Get Playwright running with basic tests

### Medium Term (1 month)
1. **Coverage Drive:** Achieve 80% code coverage
2. **Performance Optimization:** Reduce test execution time by 50%
3. **CI Integration:** Ensure reliable automated testing
4. **Test Documentation:** Update test documentation and guides

### Long Term (3 months)
1. **Test-First Development:** Implement TDD practices
2. **Visual Regression Testing:** Add visual testing capabilities
3. **Performance Testing:** Add load and stress testing
4. **Advanced E2E Scenarios:** Comprehensive user journey testing

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Continuous Monitoring Setup
- **Test Result Tracking:** Monitor daily test execution results
- **Coverage Trending:** Track coverage changes over time
- **Performance Metrics:** Monitor test execution performance
- **Flaky Test Detection:** Identify and fix unstable tests

### Alert Conditions
- Test pass rate drops below 95%
- Coverage drops below threshold
- Test execution time exceeds 10 minutes
- New failing tests introduced

## Conclusion

The testing infrastructure has a solid foundation but is currently in a **CRITICAL** state with numerous failing tests affecting core functionality. The immediate focus must be on stabilizing existing tests before expanding coverage or adding new test scenarios.

**Recommended immediate action:** Begin with chat database test fixes as they are fundamental to the application's core functionality. This will provide the biggest impact on overall test stability.
