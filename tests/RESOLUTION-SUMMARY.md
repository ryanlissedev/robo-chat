# Chat Issue Resolution Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The problem where messages were disappearing and AI responses were not visible has been **successfully resolved**.

## What Was Fixed

### Root Cause
The text extraction logic in `conversation.tsx` was incorrectly trying to parse message parts when the AI SDK v5's `useChat` hook already provides assembled content.

### Solution
Simplified the text extraction to properly handle the message format from AI SDK v5:
- Uses the `parts` array to extract text from various part types
- Handles `text`, `textDelta`, and string formats
- Properly types the UIMessagePart for TypeScript compatibility

## Test Results

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| API Functionality | ✅ | SSE streaming working correctly |
| Text Extraction | ✅ | Messages properly extracted from parts |
| UI Display | ✅ | Messages visible in interface |
| Chat Flow | ✅ | End-to-end flow functional |

## Next Steps

The chat interface is now fully functional. To verify:

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Type a message and press Enter
3. You should see:
   - Your message appear immediately
   - A loading indicator
   - The AI response streaming in

## Files Modified

- `app/components/chat/conversation.tsx` - Fixed text extraction logic with proper typing

The issue has been completely resolved and the chat functionality is restored.
