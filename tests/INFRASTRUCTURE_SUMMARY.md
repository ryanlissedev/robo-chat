# Test Infrastructure Optimization Summary

## Completed Optimizations

### 1. **Configuration Consolidation** ✅
- **Unified vitest configuration** in `/vitest.config.ts`
- **Removed duplicate config files**:
  - `tests/vitest.config.unit.ts` (deleted)
  - `tests/vitest.config.integration.ts` (deleted)
- **Environment-based configuration** using `TEST_TYPE` environment variable

### 2. **Setup Files Streamlined** ✅
- **Consolidated setup files**:
  - Primary: `tests/setup.ts` (optimized with performance flags)
  - Removed: `tests/setup-fast.ts`, `tests/setup-coverage.ts`
- **Performance-aware setup** based on test type (fast/standard/integration)
- **Optimized cleanup routines** for different test scenarios

### 3. **Debug Files Cleanup** ✅
- **Removed from project root**:
  - `debug-*.js` files
  - `test-*.js` files
  - `clear-drafts.js`
- **Removed from tests directory**:
  - All `test-*.{js,html}` temporary files
  - Duplicate test files

### 4. **Package.json Scripts Optimization** ✅
- **Updated test scripts** to use unified configuration:
  - `test:unit` - Fast unit tests with `TEST_TYPE=unit`
  - `test:integration` - Integration tests with `TEST_TYPE=integration`
  - `test:fast` - Quick unit tests with `TEST_TYPE=fast`
- **Removed duplicate/outdated scripts**
- **Fixed reporter deprecation** (basic → default)

### 5. **Performance Optimizations** ✅
- **Conditional setup** based on test type:
  - Fast mode: Minimal cleanup, no console mocking, happy-dom
  - Standard mode: Full cleanup, extensive mocking, jsdom
  - Integration mode: Sequential execution, longer timeouts
- **Optimized thread configuration**:
  - CI: Single-threaded for stability
  - Local: Multi-threaded with limits
- **Memory management** improvements

## Test Configuration Matrix

| Test Type | Environment | Timeout | Threads | Cleanup Level | Use Cases |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| `fast`/`unit` | happy-dom | 5s | Multi | Minimal | Quick unit tests |
| `standard` | jsdom | 15s | Multi* | Standard | Regular testing |
| `integration` | jsdom | 30s | Single | Full | API/DB tests |

*Single-threaded in CI for stability

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- Multiple configuration files with overlapping settings
- Redundant setup files with duplicate mocks
- Inconsistent cleanup between test types
- Debug files scattered throughout project
- Deprecated reporter usage

### After Optimization:
- Single, unified configuration with environment-based switching
- Streamlined setup with performance-aware initialization
- Optimized cleanup strategies per test type
- Clean project structure
- Modern reporter configuration

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Fast unit tests (minimal setup, happy-dom)
npm run test:unit

# Standard tests (full setup, jsdom)  
npm test

# Integration tests (sequential, extended timeouts)
npm run test:integration

# Coverage reporting
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Faster test execution** - Optimized setup based on test type
2. **Better isolation** - Improved cleanup strategies prevent cross-test contamination
3. **Cleaner codebase** - Removed debug and temporary files
4. **Consistent configuration** - Single source of truth for test settings
5. **Performance monitoring** - Built-in performance tracking capabilities
6. **Memory leak prevention** - Advanced cleanup utilities in `tests/utils/test-cleanup.ts`

## Configuration Features

- **Environment-based switching** via `TEST_TYPE` environment variable
- **Conditional mocking** for performance optimization  
- **Thread pool optimization** for different test scenarios
- **Coverage configuration** per environment (dev/ci/production)
- **Advanced cleanup tracking** with memory leak detection

The test infrastructure is now optimized for both performance and maintainability, with clear separation of concerns between different test types.
