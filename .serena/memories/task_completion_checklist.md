# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Submitting Code

### 1. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Type checking
bun run type-check

# Linting
bun run lint

# Fix any linting issues
bun run lint --fix
```

### 2. Testing Requirements
```bash
# Unit tests must pass
bun run test

# Coverage requirements (minimum 80%)
bun run test:coverage

# E2E tests must pass
bun run test:e2e

# Specific browser testing if needed
bun run test:e2e --project=chromium
bun run test:e2e --project=firefox
bun run test:e2e --project=webkit
```

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Production build must succeed
bun run build

# Verify build output
ls -la .next/

# Test production build locally
bun run start
```

### 4. Security & Performance
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Proper input validation and sanitization
- [ ] CSRF protection where applicable
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Optimized bundle size (check with bundle analyzer)
- [ ] Proper error handling and user feedback

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md if adding new features
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- [ ] Update API documentation if changing endpoints
- [ ] Add or update test cases for new functionality

### 6. Git Workflow
```bash
# Ensure clean working directory
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"

# Push to feature branch
git push origin feature-branch-name
```

### 7. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations applied (if applicable)
- [ ] Vercel deployment successful
- [ ] Production smoke tests passed
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled

## Testing Standards

### Unit Test Requirements
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% for functions, lines, branches, statements
- **Test Types**: Happy path, edge cases, error conditions
- **Mocking**: External dependencies properly mocked
- **Assertions**: Specific and meaningful assertions

### E2E Test Requirements
- **Browser Coverage**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (WebKit)
- **Responsive Testing**: Desktop and mobile viewports
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **Performance**: Page load times and interaction responsiveness

### Test File Organization
```
tests/
├── unit/              # Unit tests (if not co-located)
├── integration/       # Integration tests
├── e2e/              # End-to-end tests
│   ├── pages/        # Page object models
│   └── fixtures/     # Test data and fixtures
└── setup/            # Test configuration and setup
```

## Code Review Checklist

### Functionality
- [ ] Code solves the intended problem
- [ ] Edge cases are handled appropriately
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Performance implications considered

### Code Quality
- [ ] Follows established coding conventions
- [ ] Functions are focused and single-purpose
- [ ] Variable and function names are descriptive
- [ ] Code is readable and well-commented

### Testing
- [ ] Adequate test coverage
- [ ] Tests are meaningful and not just for coverage

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The CI pipeline automatically runs:
1. **Validation**: Lint, type-check, format check
2. **Testing**: Unit tests with coverage, E2E tests
3. **Build**: Production build verification
4. **Security**: Dependency audit, security scanning
5. **Deployment**: Automatic deployment on main branch

### Local Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Lefthook configuration runs:
# - Linting and formatting
# - Type checking
# - Unit tests for changed files
# - Security checks
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS
- **Bundle Size**: JavaScript and CSS bundle sizes
- **API Response Times**: Chat API and other endpoints
- **Error Rates**: Client and server error tracking
- **User Experience**: LangSmith tracing and feedback

### Tools Used
- **Vercel Analytics**: Performance and user metrics
- **LangSmith**: AI interaction tracing and analysis
- **Bundle Analyzer**: JavaScript bundle size analysis
- **Lighthouse**: Performance and accessibility auditing
