It does not matter which slider you measure.\n\n\u25aa Enter the distance (in mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). \u25aa Select Submit value. \u25aa Select Continue. \u25aa Select Home infeed.\n\nSubsequently, to make sure that the home position of the sliders is correct: \u25aa Accurately measure the distance between the end of the slider and the end stop of the infeed table\n\nagain.\n\nIf the distance = 5 mm (\u2155\u201d): \u27a2 Calibration of the infeed table was successful. \u25aa Select Return to the main screen.\n\nIf the distance is \u2260 5 mm (\u2155\u201d): \u25aa Select Go back to the previous step and repeat the procedure.\n\n      Side view  Image 6  Distance between end of slider and end  stop   Top view  \n\nPage 14/18\n\nversion 0.0 | 29-3-2024\n\n  \n\nCalibration\n\nFAQ RoboRail\n\n3.7 Calibration of the infeed | material\n\nThis calibration procedure sets the correct infeed position of the material. An incorrect position can cause problems to load the material and incorrect cutting positions.\n\nFor the calibration of the infeed position of the material, do the procedure that follows: \u25aa In the Calibration menu: select the button Infeed material position calibration. \u25aa Select Continue. \u25aa Select Home infeed to put the infeed at its home position. \u25aa Select Home trolley to move the trolley to the rear. This is a safe position of the trolley during the\n\ncalibration process.\n\n\u25aa Select Continue. \u25aa Select Infeed forward and/or Infeed backward to move the infeed just after the centerline of the bogies ( Image 7). In this position the infeed sliders are at 1 to max. 5 mm (\u00b9/25 to max. \u2155\u201d) after the center of the bogies.\n\n\u25aa Select Submit position. \u25aa Select Finish.\n\nImage 7 Position of the infeed sliders\n\nPage 15/18\n\nversion 0.0 | 29-3-2024\n\n  \n\nCalibration\n\nFAQ RoboRail\n\nMetal profiles | shapes\n\n               Round tube/pipe   Square tube   Channel   Flat bar   Angle  "
