When found to be in incapable of safe opera\ufffdon the machine must be withdrawn from service. Do not work with the machine if it is damaged or not in good working condi\ufffdon. Quali\ufb01ed personnel must repair the machine prior to its next use.\n\nStop the machine in such a way that another worker is unable to start the machine when you must work on or in the machine. Only reach into the machine unless the machine is completely switched o\ufb00. The cell door cannot be opened during the cu\ufffdng process. The window of the cu\ufffdng cell has UV protec\ufffdon shield to protect your eyes. Never look directly at the torch during cu\ufffdng, the bright light could damage your eyesight. Always use the advised Personal Protec\ufffdon Equipment. Wear a helmet if material is being loaded using an overhead crane or a forkli\ufffd.\n\n2.2 The machine is designed to be safe. Despite all risk reduc\ufffdon measures, care must always be taken when opera\ufffdng the machine. Parts or machine components that are colored orange may move suddenly or unexpectedly. Some risks cannot be eliminated, the greatest poten\ufffdal residual risks are:\n\nWedging/crushing \u2022 Burning (skin injury) \u2022 Falling material\n\nCAUTION! WEDGING, CRUSHING HAZARD Infeed table, machine frame, cell Personnel can be hit by the moving robot or material, burned by heat, a\ufb00ected by arc radia\ufffdon, fumes, sparks, noise and laser radia\ufffdon. Personnel can be drawn in or wedged. Keep the door of the cell closed during cu\ufffdng. Stay behind the remote control as long as the machine is in opera\ufffdon. Do not approach the ou\ufffdeed or infeed table. Maintenance mode is for maintenance and trouble-shoo\ufffdng purposes only. Do not step in or reach into the machine. Wear advised PPE.\n\n  \n\nCAUTION! BURNING HAZARD HOT MATERIAL, COMPONENTS, PARTS OR SCRAP The plasma process generates high temperatures. Material coming out of the machine can be very hot. Components of the machine can be very hot. Give material and components of the machine \ufffdme to cool down before touching them. Always wear boots and \ufb01reproof gloves when handling material or removing scrap pieces.\n\nPage 5/62\n\nversion 2.1 | 24-4-2024\n\n  \n\nPage 6/62\n\nRoboRail Operator\u2019s manual\n\nCAUTION! WEDGING CRUSHING HAZARD FALLING MATERIAL, PARTS OR SCRAP Sharp and hot workpieces and scrap can fall out of the front chuck on and or/from the infeed table. Use non-\ufb02ammable containers for work pieces and scrap. Keep your distance and wear the recommended PPE.\n\nWARNING HEALTH RISK, RISK OF SUFFOCATION The plasma cu\ufffdng process may create hazardous substances. Cu\ufffdng galvanized and stainless steel creates toxic gasses and pose a health risk. Remove these gases from the work \ufb02oor and release them outside. Use a dust collector and change \ufb01lters regularly. Keep the cell door closed and allow \ufffdme for gases to escape through the system. Do not inhale smoke. read the manual of the plasma unit for more informa\ufffdon.\n\nCAUTION! HEARING DAMAGE The plasma cu\ufffdng process generates noise emissions above 70 dB(A). Permanent hearing damage occurs with prolonged exposure. Hearing protec\ufffdon must be worn at all \ufffdmes.\n\nWARNING! FIRE HAZARD Flammable materials in the vicinity of the machine The plasma cu\ufffdng process generates high temperatures and sparks. Flammable and combus\ufffdble materials may catch \ufb01re. Never use the machine in a \ufb02ammable or explosive environment. Remove \ufb02ammable and combus\ufffdble materials (oil, paint, etc.) from the vicinity of the machine and keep them at least 35 feet /10 meters away. Use a non- \ufb02ammable container for work pieces and scrap.\n\nWARNING! FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARD Gas cylinders and torch Use gas cylinders responsibly according to na\ufffdonal and local regula\ufffdons. Keep cylinders, valves, regulators torch and consumables free from grease or oil."

HGG recommends these gases be released to the exterior. When cutting stainless steel HGG STRONGLY advises that fumes are ALWAYS released outside*.\n\nThe material being cut can be a source of toxic fumes or gases that deplete oxygen. Exhaust gases pose a health risk when they are not removed from the work floor. Wait until the smoke has been extracted before opening the cell door.\n\nTo reduce the risk of exposure to fumes:\n\nRemove all solvents from the metal before cutting. \u2022 Use local exhaust ventilation to remove fumes from the air. \u2022 Do not inhale fumes, wait a while to open the door to give fumes the time to leave the cell. \u2022 Monitor or test the air quality at the site as needed.\n\nConsult with a local expert to implement a site plan to make sure air quality is safe.\n\nPage 7/62\n\nversion 2.1 | 24-4-2024\n\n  \n\nRoboRail Operator\u2019s manual\n\n2.8 Keep the labels on the machine in good condition.

A desiccant should be used in the control unit cabinets and other electrical components (in the event of extended storage change the desiccant regularly). Ven\ufffdlate the area periodically. The \ufb02oor should also be damp proof or damp-proof padding should be laid before storage.\n\nMost parts of the machine are painted or coated to prevent rus\ufffdng. However, some parts are exposed to the air and should be oiled or greased regularly for protec\ufffdon.
