In that case you need another tool.\n\nTo align the chucks, do the procedure that follows: The cover of the trolley is attached with 2x3 Allen screws with washers at the front (left + right) and 2x3 at the back (left + right) ( Image 1). \u25aa \u25aa Remove the cover of the trolley.\n\nThe rear chuck is attached with 2 bolts at both sides of the trolley. These are the bolts on the black plate ( Image 2). \u25aa \u27a2 This makes it possible to move the rear chuck manually. \u25aa \u25aa Slightly move the rear chuck to get it aligned with the front chuck.\n\nThe preferred movement is to slide the rear chuck horizontally. If you must turn the chuck to align it, make sure not to twist the chucks relative to each other to avoid distortion of the material. Turn the chuck carefully and only if necessary.\n\n\u25aa Make sure that the distance between the black plate and the orange material is equal over the entire length of the plate ( Image 3). This applies to the black plate on both sides of the trolley.\n\n\u25aa Use the switch [Y+] on the control panel of the trolley (or the arrow button on the screen) to move the trolley fully forward.\n\n\u25aa Keep an eye on the Laser value on the screen and move the trolley to the rear with switch [Y\u2012] (or the arrow button on the screen). Make sure that the laser beam continues to hit the material.\n\nIf the laser value increases: \u25aa Move the rear chuck slightly to the left to align it with the front chuck. \u25aa\n\nIf the laser value decreases: \u25aa Move the rear chuck slightly to the right to align it with the front chuck. \u25aa\n\nPage 1/2\n\nversion 0.0 | 8-4-2024\n\n  \n\nCalibration\n\nFAQ RoboRail\n\nSubsequently: \u25aa\n\nIf necessary/desired: do the steps to move the trolley forward and rearward again and make sure that the Laser value on the screen remains below 2 (mm).\n\n\u25aa Tighten the bolts (2x2 pcs) to attach the rear chuck to the trolley. \u25aa Install the cover of the trolley with the Allen screws and washers. \u25aa Select Return to home on the screen.\n\n      Image 1  One set of 3 Allen  screws (total 12)   Image 2  Bolts below the chuck (2 sides)   Image 3  Equal distance between the black   plate and the orange material     \n\nPage 2/2\n\nversion 0.0 | 8-4-2024"
