Our team has several diagnostic tools at their disposal. To help you successfully it is very important that the following information is as complete as possible. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.111,t=0.065,r=0.886,b=0.178), with ID 5e4336f2-482a-4d77-a8bf-e11c8602e221 -->\n\nSummary : This image is a screenshot showing the first step in a process for generating data collection in a software interface, specifically by navigating to the \"Advanced\" menu and selecting \"Generate data collection.\" The screenshot includes a highlighted dropdown menu, a process flow diagram, and various control buttons.\n\nscreenshot:  \nScene Overview : \n  • The main subject is a software interface for an HGG system, with a dark background and several UI elements.\n  • The top left shows a dropdown menu under \"Advanced,\" with \"Generate data collection\" highlighted in red.\n  • The center displays a horizontal process flow diagram with circular nodes, starting from \"Machine started\" to \"Infeed homed\" and continuing through several steps.\n  • The HGG logo is visible on the left side.\n  • The right side contains multiple rectangular control buttons, such as \"Move robot arm to in,\" \"Move robot arm to left,\" \"Move robot arm to right,\" and others.\n  • The bottom bar includes status indicators and a \"Quit application\" button.\n\nTechnical Details : \n  • No scale bar or magnification is present.\n  • The dropdown menu includes options: \"Advanced Dev,\" \"Robot base calculator,\" \"Profile correction,\" \"Cutting Table,\" \"PowerMax Dialog,\" \"Generate data collection,\" \"Press Plate,\" \"Force user maintenance mode,\" and \"Maintenance mode.\"\n  • The process flow diagram nodes are: \"Machine started,\" \"Infeed homed,\" \"Outfeed loaded,\" \"Error check loaded,\" \"Motor check loaded,\" and \"Safety loaded.\"\n  • The highlighted menu item is \"Generate data collection.\"\n\nSpatial Relationships : \n  • The dropdown menu is in the upper left, overlaying the main interface.\n  • The process flow diagram runs horizontally across the center.\n  • Control buttons are grouped on the right, with status and navigation at the bottom.\n\nAnalysis : \n  • The screenshot visually instructs the user to access the \"Generate data collection\" function via the \"Advanced\" menu as the first step in a larger workflow.\n  • The process flow diagram suggests a sequential workflow, with the current step (\"Infeed homed\") highlighted.\n  • The interface is designed for stepwise operation, with clear navigation and control options for machine operation. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.187,r=0.805,b=0.448), with ID ffec53f6-a2f8-4742-b22b-4cf22a15636f -->\n\n-  Step 2.

Add additional cutting files from external applications\" at the top and \"Step 4. Create collection\" at the bottom.\n\nTechnical Details : \n  • The dialog box contains two main sections: \"Description\" and \"Additional files\".\n  • The \"Description\" field includes a prompt: \"Short description of what the machine was doing at the moment, if there has been maintenance recently, etc.\" and a sample input: \"What went wrong, what is the machine number, when did the problem start, other information HGG might need\".\n  • The \"Additional files\" section instructs users to add files via the \"Add\" button or drag-and-drop, supporting file types such as ProCAM project (.pcd), DSTV files (.dstv), and NC Data (.nc1).\n  • There are three buttons: \"Add\", \"Remove\", and \"Create Collection\", with \"Cancel\" as an option.\n\nSpatial Relationships : \n  • The \"Description\" field is at the top, followed by the \"Additional files\" section.\n  • Action buttons are aligned to the right and bottom of the dialog box.\n\nAnalysis : \n  • The screenshot visually guides users through the process of supplementing a data collection with external files and finalizing the collection, emphasizing the importance of detailed descriptions and relevant file attachments. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.596,r=0.751,b=0.891), with ID 4df7d854-9cd8-4d5b-a393-974e612daba1 -->\n\nSend to HGG <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.114,t=0.065,r=0.238,b=0.086), with ID 00ad1927-7b7e-4a6e-9664-a1f30b4ff3b4 -->\n\nYou are now ready to send the information to HGG.
