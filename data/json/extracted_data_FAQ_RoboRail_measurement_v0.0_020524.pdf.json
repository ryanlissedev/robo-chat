Measurements & data collection\n\n3.1 Measurements\n\nThe material that you measure must be free of burrs and slags to get accurate measurement results.\n\n\u25aa \u25aa Measure the material(s) and/or cut(s) as specified by HGG. According to the size and shape of material,\n\nuse one of the tools as described in this document.\n\n\u27a2 To measure round and rectangular tubes/pipes, make sure to take the centerline distance ( Image 8). This is the distance related to the exact center of the material.\n\n      Image 8  Centerline of a round and   rectangular tube/pipe  \n\n\u27a2 To measure channels, flat bars and angles, take the longest length of the material/cut.\n\n3.2 Diagnostic data collection\n\nIn addition to the measurement results, HGG needs a download of relevant files. These data are necessary to examine the cause of the cutting problem.\n\nOn the screen do the procedure that follows: \u25aa \u25aa\n\nIn the Advanced menu: select Generate data collection (extension .7z). In the Description box: enter the following information as complete as possible: - - a description of what went wrong - when the problem started - any other information that may be useful to HGG to solve the problem In the Additional files box: add additional cutting files* from external applications.\n\n\u25aa\n\nCutting files such as: ProCAM project (.pcd) | DSTV files (.dstv) | NC Data (.nc1)\n\nYou can do this in two ways: - Use the Add button and select the files with which there is a cutting problem; or - Drag and drop the files from and external application."
