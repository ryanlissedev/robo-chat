If they are not aligned, it can have a negative effect on the cutting quality.\n\nThe RoboRail is supplied with a tube (L = 2 m, 120 x 120 mm*) as reference part. If this tube is not available anymore, you must take an alternative square tube – with very accurate dimensions – that you use as a reference part. Dimensions of the alternative tube: min. 120 x 120 mm | max. 200 x 200 mm*\n\nFor USA:\n\ndimensions of the reference tube are L = 7 ft, 4 x 8”, thickness = ⅛” - dimensions of an alternative tube must be min. min. 5 x 5” / max. 8 x 8”\n\nTo verify if alignment of the front and rear chucks is necessary, do the procedure that follows: ▪ ▪ Select Continue.\n\nIf you use the reference tube supplied with the RoboRail: ** ▪ Enter profile width: 120,00 (mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). ▪ Enter profile height: 120,00 (mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). ▪ Enter Submit values.\n\n** For USA, if you did not receive the square tube but the 4 x 8” tube or if you did not receive any tube:\n\nskip this instruction and continue with the next (“If you use an alternative square tube:”) - enter the dimensions in mm (1” = 25.4 mm)\n\nIf you use an alternative square tube: ▪ Accurately measure the outside dimensions of the tube (height and width). ▪ Enter the width and the height of the tube (in mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). Max.\n\n= Enter the width and the height of the tube (in mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). Max. value: 200 mm.\n\nvalue: 200 mm. ▪ Select Submit values.\n\nSubsequently: ▪ Select Open front chuck. ▪ ▪ Select Close front chuck. ▪ Select Continue. ▪ Select Approach material. The field Laser value on the screen shows a certain value. ▪ Use the switch [Y+] on the control panel of the trolley (or the arrow button on the screen) to move\n\nthe trolley fully forward.\n\n▪ Keep an eye on the Laser value on the screen and move the trolley to the rear with switch [Y‒] (or the arrow button on the screen). Make sure that the laser beam continues to hit the material.\n\n▪ Select Finish.\n\nIf the laser value changes more than 2 (mm) you must align the chucks.\n\nPage 12/18\n\nversion 0.0 | 29-3-2024\n\n  \n\nCalibration\n\nFor the procedure to align the chucks: ▪ Contact the HGG service department.\n\nPage 13/18\n\nFAQ RoboRail\n\nversion 0.0 | 29-3-2024\n\n  \n\nCalibration\n\nFAQ RoboRail",

In this position the sliders put the material in the center of the bogies.\n\nNecessary tool:\n\n5\n\nMeasuring tape\n\nFor the calibration of the position of the infeed table, do the procedure that follows: ▪ ▪ Select Continue. ▪ Select Home infeed to move the infeed sliders to their home position. In this position the sliders are fully\n\nretracted and they are near the end stops.\n\n▪ Select Continue. ▪ Accurately measure the distance between the end of the slider and the end stop of the infeed table (this\n\nis the hook behind the slider) ( Image 6). It does not matter which slider you measure.\n\n▪ Enter the distance (in mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). ▪ Select Submit value. ▪ Select Continue. ▪ Select Home infeed.\n\nSubsequently, to make sure that the home position of the sliders is correct: ▪ Accurately measure the distance between the end of the slider and the end stop of the infeed table\n\nagain.\n\nIf the distance = 5 mm (⅕”): ➢ Calibration of the infeed table was successful. ▪ Select Return to the main screen.\n\nIf the distance is ≠ 5 mm (⅕”): ▪ Select Go back to the previous step and repeat the procedure.\n\n      Side view  Image 6  Distance between end of slider and end  stop   Top view  \n\nPage 14/18\n\nversion 0.0 | 29-3-2024\n\n  \n\nCalibration\n\nFAQ RoboRail\n\n3.7 Calibration of the infeed | material\n\nThis calibration procedure sets the correct infeed position of the material. An incorrect position can cause problems to load the material and incorrect cutting positions.\n\nFor the calibration of the infeed position of the material, do the procedure that follows: ▪ In the Calibration menu: select the button Infeed material position calibration. ▪ Select Continue. ▪ Select Home infeed to put the infeed at its home position. ▪ Select Home trolley to move the trolley to the rear. This is a safe position of the trolley during the\n\ncalibration process.\n\n▪ Select Continue. ▪ Select Infeed forward and/or Infeed backward to move the infeed just after the centerline of the bogies ( Image 7). In this position the infeed sliders are at 1 to max. 5 mm (¹/25 to max. ⅕”) after the center of the bogies.\n\n▪ Select Submit position. ▪ Select Finish.\n\nImage 7 Position of the infeed sliders\n\nPage 15/18\n\nversion 0.0 | 29-3-2024\n\n  \n\nCalibration\n\nFAQ RoboRail\n\nMetal profiles | shapes\n\n               Round tube/pipe   Square tube   Channel   Flat bar   Angle  ",
