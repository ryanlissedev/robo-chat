When found to be in incapable of safe opera�on the machine must be withdrawn from service. Do not work with the machine if it is damaged or not in good working condi�on. Qualiﬁed personnel must repair the machine prior to its next use.\n\nStop the machine in such a way that another worker is unable to start the machine when you must work on or in the machine. Only reach into the machine unless the machine is completely switched oﬀ. The cell door cannot be opened during the cu�ng process. The window of the cu�ng cell has UV protec�on shield to protect your eyes. Never look directly at the torch during cu�ng, the bright light could damage your eyesight. Always use the advised Personal Protec�on Equipment. Wear a helmet if material is being loaded using an overhead crane or a forkli�.\n\n2.2 The machine is designed to be safe. Despite all risk reduc�on measures, care must always be taken when opera�ng the machine. Parts or machine components that are colored orange may move suddenly or unexpectedly. Some risks cannot be eliminated, the greatest poten�al residual risks are:\n\nWedging/crushing • Burning (skin injury) • Falling material\n\nCAUTION! WEDGING, CRUSHING HAZARD Infeed table, machine frame, cell Personnel can be hit by the moving robot or material, burned by heat, aﬀected by arc radia�on, fumes, sparks, noise and laser radia�on. Personnel can be drawn in or wedged. Keep the door of the cell closed during cu�ng. Stay behind the remote control as long as the machine is in opera�on. Do not approach the ou�eed or infeed table. Maintenance mode is for maintenance and trouble-shoo�ng purposes only. Do not step in or reach into the machine. Wear advised PPE.\n\n  \n\nCAUTION! BURNING HAZARD HOT MATERIAL, COMPONENTS, PARTS OR SCRAP The plasma process generates high temperatures. Material coming out of the machine can be very hot. Components of the machine can be very hot. Give material and components of the machine �me to cool down before touching them. Always wear boots and ﬁreproof gloves when handling material or removing scrap pieces.\n\nPage 5/62\n\nversion 2.1 | 24-4-2024\n\n  \n\nPage 6/62\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual\n\nCAUTION! WEDGING CRUSHING HAZARD FALLING MATERIAL, PARTS OR SCRAP Sharp and hot workpieces and scrap can fall out of the front chuck on and or/from the infeed table. Use non-ﬂammable containers for work pieces and scrap. Keep your distance and wear the recommended PPE.\n\nWARNING HEALTH RISK, RISK OF SUFFOCATION The plasma cu�ng process may create hazardous substances. Cu�ng galvanized and stainless steel creates toxic gasses and pose a health risk. Remove these gases from the work ﬂoor and release them outside. Use a dust collector and change ﬁlters regularly. Keep the cell door closed and allow �me for gases to escape through the system. Do not inhale smoke. read the manual of the plasma unit for more informa�on.\n\nCAUTION! HEARING DAMAGE The plasma cu�ng process generates noise emissions above 70 dB(A). Permanent hearing damage occurs with prolonged exposure. Hearing protec�on must be worn at all �mes.\n\nWARNING! FIRE HAZARD Flammable materials in the vicinity of the machine The plasma cu�ng process generates high temperatures and sparks. Flammable and combus�ble materials may catch ﬁre. Never use the machine in a ﬂammable or explosive environment. Remove ﬂammable and combus�ble materials (oil, paint, etc.) from the vicinity of the machine and keep them at least 35 feet /10 meters away. Use a non- ﬂammable container for work pieces and scrap.\n\nWARNING! FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARD Gas cylinders and torch Use gas cylinders responsibly according to na�onal and local regula�ons. Keep cylinders, valves, regulators torch and consumables free from grease or oil.",

Let hot metal cool down before handling it or let it touch combus�ble materials.\n\n2.6 Gas cylinders contain a gas under high pressure, if damaged a cylinder can explode. Handle and use cylinders in accordance with applicable na�onal and local regula�ons.\n\nAlways:\n\nUse only cylinders that are undamaged.\n\nUse cylinders in an upright and secured posi�on.\n\nKeep all gas equipment and parts in good condi�on, replace damaged or worn components.\n\nUse gas equipment for only the type of gas they are designed and intended for\n\nNever:\n\nLubricate gas- cylinders, -valves or -regulators with grease or oil.\n\nUse tools to open a stuck cylinder.\n\n2.7 The exhaust gases from the fume extraction and dust collection systems must be removed from the work floor according to local health and safety regulations. HGG recommends these gases be released to the exterior. When cutting stainless steel HGG STRONGLY advises that fumes are ALWAYS released outside*.\n\nThe material being cut can be a source of toxic fumes or gases that deplete oxygen. Exhaust gases pose a health risk when they are not removed from the work floor. Wait until the smoke has been extracted before opening the cell door.\n\nTo reduce the risk of exposure to fumes:\n\nRemove all solvents from the metal before cutting. • Use local exhaust ventilation to remove fumes from the air. • Do not inhale fumes, wait a while to open the door to give fumes the time to leave the cell. • Monitor or test the air quality at the site as needed.\n\nConsult with a local expert to implement a site plan to make sure air quality is safe.\n\nPage 7/62\n\nversion 2.1 | 24-4-2024\n\n  \n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual\n\n2.8 Keep the labels on the machine in good condition.

A desiccant should be used in the control unit cabinets and other electrical components (in the event of extended storage change the desiccant regularly). Ven�late the area periodically. The ﬂoor should also be damp proof or damp-proof padding should be laid before storage.\n\nMost parts of the machine are painted or coated to prevent rus�ng. However, some parts are exposed to the air and should be oiled or greased regularly for protec�on. Alterna�vely, spray the parts with oil and seal with plas�c coa�ng (in the event of extended storage check the parts regularly). Treat all exposed parts, pay par�cular aten�on to the conveyor rollers, the cylinder sha�s and the infeed and ou�eed storage. All hoses and cables should be shielded by protec�ve covering to prevent damage.\n\nPage 18/62\n\nversion 2.1 | 24-4-2024\n\n  \n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual",

Several proﬁles can be placed on the side load infeed table, which are straightened by the driven chains and arms. The sliders move one proﬁle and place it on the bogies. Once over the bogies, the sliders lower, leaving the proﬁle on the bogies, retrac�ng the arms and return to their home posi�on.\n\nThe conveyor can be controlled from the touch screen on the remote control, either in the material handling screen by selec�ng the conveyor or in the diagnos�cs screen under the conveyor tab.\n\n   Slider      and       Arm   Star�ng posi�on: Infeed table is homed and arms are up.

The machine starts up automa�cally. If an ac�on is required, the machine will show this, with addi�onal instruc�ons, if needed. The buton at the botom center of the screen is always the next step. It’s appearance will change accordingly to the state of the machine. The user interface will only display butons that are allowed to be clicked in that speciﬁc state to prevent confusion.\n\nAll 4 phases are described below and the steps that need to be taken are divided into 2 types.\n\n1. Manual (M), an ac�on is required from the operator (Orange). 2. Automa�c (A), the machine performs this ac�on automa�cally (Blue).\n\nNOTE! The images used to visualize the user interface do not show the whole func�onality of the interface and are primarily used as a guideline.

      "text": "9.4 Tool calibra�on of the robot\n\nTool calibration makes sure that the robot exactly knows the position of the torch, including the distance of the torch above the material. This calibration procedure can be important if the torch is bent due to the heat of the cutting process.\n\nBefore you start: Make sure that there is no material inside the cu�ng cell. Make sure that you have equipped the torch with 125 A consumables ( Image 3).\n\n(Consumables of 65 A are 3 mm too short for calibration purposes.)\n\nMake sure that the cu�ng cell is closed.\n\nIn case of large cu�ng faults (>10 mm / ⅜”) before calibra�on: Put the robot in Slow mode (botom le� of the screen) so you can stop it before it hits the sensor or the\n\n= Put the robot in Slow mode (bottom left of the screen) so you can stop it before it hits the sensor or the robot cell.\n\nrobot cell. If this happens during the calibra�on process: push the Emergency buton on the remote control to stop the robot.\n\n=\n\nFor the tool calibra�on of the robot, do the procedure that follows: In the Calibra�on menu: select the buton Tool calibra�on. Inside the cu�ng cell: remove the cover of the tool sensor. Select I have removed the sensor cover and equipped the 125amp consumables. Select Con�nue. Select Start tool calibra�on. Tool calibra�on consists of three moving and turning cycles to set the torch posi�on oﬀsets correctly. This\n\nvalue is automa�cally saved.\n\nMake sure that the laser beam touches the black (=upper) part of the torch ( Image 4). If it touches the white (=lower) part of the torch: contact the HGG service department.\n\nWhen the tool calibra�on is completed: Select Done. Select Return to home. The torch posi�on is correct.\n\nIf the tool calibra�on of the robot did not solve the problem: Con�nue with § 3.3 to do a base calibra�on of the robot.\n\n      Image 3  Consumables 125 A   Image 4  Laser posi�on on  the torch  \n\nPage 51/62\n\nversion 2.1 | 24-4-2024\n\n  \n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual\n\n9.5 Calibra�on of the trolley\n\nCalibration of the trolley sets the correct position of the trolley related to the robot. If the home position of the trolley is not correct, it can cause incorrect product sizes.\n\nFor the calibra�on of the posi�on of the trolley, do the procedure that follows: In the Calibra�on menu: select the buton Trolley posi�on calibra�on. Select Go to step 1. Select Home the trolley to move the trolley to the rear. Accurately measure the distance between the rear of the trolley and the hook ( Image 5). Enter the distance (in mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). Select Submit values. Select Home trolley.\n\nSubsequently, to make sure that the home posi�on of the trolley is correct: Accurately measure the distance between the rear of the trolley and the hook again.\n\nIf the distance = 35 mm (1⅜”): Calibra�on of the trolley was successful. Select Return to home.\n\nIf the distance is ≠ 35 mm (1⅜”): Repeat the calibra�on procedure.\n\nSubsequently: Con�nue with § 3.5 to align the front and rear chucks.\n\nImage 5 Distance between trolley and hook\n\n9.6 Calibra�on of the infeed | home posi�on\n\nCalibration of the infeed table makes sure that the home position of the infeed sliders is correct. In this position the sliders put the material in the center of the bogies.\n\nNecessary tool:\n\nPage 52/62\n\nversion 2.1 | 24-4-2024\n\n  \n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual\n\nMeasuring tape\n\nFor the calibra�on of the posi�on of the infeed table, do the procedure that follows: Select Con�nue. Select Home infeed to move the infeed sliders to their home posi�on. In this posi�on the sliders are fully\n\nretracted and they are near the end stops.\n\nSelect Con�nue.
