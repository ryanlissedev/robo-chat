Line up one side of the angle with 0° on the protractor.\n\n   Image 4  Angle measurement [digital  protractor | 90,5°]   Image 5  Angle measurement [analog  protractor | 86°]  \n\n2.3 Tape measure\n\nA tape measure is a flexible ruler that you use to measure: - - -\n\nthe distance between two opposite sites of a material or cut the length of a material or cut the size of a material\n\nIt is applicable to measure cutting sizes and material with a length of 0,3 to 12 m (1 to 40 ft).\n\nPage 5/10\n\nversion 0.0 | 2-5-2024\n\n  \n\nMeasurement instructions\n\nFAQ RoboRail\n\nTape measure Class I according to EU Directive 2014/32/EU   Preferred tool   THUMB LOCK   TAPE   HOOK         Class I allows a tolerance over the entire length of:  0,3 mm at 2 m | 0,4 mm at 3 m | 0,6 mm at 5 m |  0,9 mm at 8 m | 1,1 mm at 10 m      For USA:   Make sure that you use a tape measure with the highest  available accuracy for professional use, with a permitted  tolerance over the entire length of max. 1/16” at 33 ft.  \n\nTHUMB LOCK   TAPE   HOOK  \n\nImage: example of a retractable tape measure\n\nHow to use a tape measure\n\n➢ The temperature range for use of the tape measure is 20°C ± 8°C (54 to 82°F). Do not exceed this range to prevent measurement errors due to shrink or expansion of the tape.\n\n➢ The hook at the end of the tape is ‘floating’ to provide both inside and outside measurements that are accurate.\n\n➢ The thumb lock is used to keep the tape in place at the desired length and stops it from automatically retracting back into its housing\n\n➢ Tape measures are available with a metric and/or an imperial scale;\n\nmetric markings are displayed in mm, cm and m -\n\nimperial markings are displayed in feet (F), inches and fractions of inches\n\nTo measure the inside of a material or cut ( Image 6): ▪ Put the hook at the inside of the material that you intend to measure. ▪ Extend the tape to the opposite site of the material or cut and lock it.",

Measurements & data collection\n\n3.1 Measurements\n\nThe material that you measure must be free of burrs and slags to get accurate measurement results.\n\n▪ ▪ Measure the material(s) and/or cut(s) as specified by HGG. According to the size and shape of material,\n\nuse one of the tools as described in this document.\n\n➢ To measure round and rectangular tubes/pipes, make sure to take the centerline distance ( Image 8). This is the distance related to the exact center of the material.\n\n      Image 8  Centerline of a round and   rectangular tube/pipe  \n\n➢ To measure channels, flat bars and angles, take the longest length of the material/cut.\n\n3.2 Diagnostic data collection\n\nIn addition to the measurement results, HGG needs a download of relevant files. These data are necessary to examine the cause of the cutting problem.\n\nOn the screen do the procedure that follows: ▪ ▪\n\nIn the Advanced menu: select Generate data collection (extension .7z). In the Description box: enter the following information as complete as possible: - - a description of what went wrong - when the problem started - any other information that may be useful to HGG to solve the problem In the Additional files box: add additional cutting files* from external applications.\n\n▪\n\nCutting files such as: ProCAM project (.pcd) | DSTV files (.dstv) | NC Data (.nc1)\n\nYou can do this in two ways: - Use the Add button and select the files with which there is a cutting problem; or - Drag and drop the files from and external application.",
