Tools \n\nDepending on the size/type of the material/cut, you need one of the following measurement tools. \n\n2.1 Caliper \n\nA caliper is an instrument that you use to measure: \n- the distance between two opposite sides of a material or cut \n- the inner diameter of a material or cut \n- the outer diameter of a material \n\nIt is applicable to measure cutting sizes and material with a maximum length of 300 mm (12”).\n\nPreferred tool: \ndigital \n\nCaliper with a rated accuracy of 0,1 mm (0.004”) \nAlternative tool: \nanalog \n\n \nImages: examples of a digital and analog caliper \n\nHow to use a caliper \n\n➢ If you use a digital caliper, also refer to the user manual of your specific type. \n\n \n\n \n➢ Make sure that you use a caliper of an appropriate length. \n➢ Use the locking screw to lock the position of the jaws. \n➢ Digital caliper: use the thumb wheel for fine adjustment of the jaws.\n\nTHUMB WHEEL \n\nFAQ RoboRail \nMeasurement instructions \n\nPage 4/10 version 0.0 | 2-5-2024 \nTo measure the inside of a material or cut ( Image 1): \n▪ Put the internal jaws inside the material that you intend to measure. Extend the jaws to touch the \nmaterial and lock them.\n\nImage 1 Inside measurement \n[digital caliper | 30,06 mm] \n\nTo measure the outside of a material ( Image 2 | Image 3): \n▪ Put the external jaws around the material that you intend to measure. Close the jaws and lock them.\n\nImage 2 Outside measurement \n[digital caliper | 35,51 mm] \nImage 3 Outside measurement \n[digital caliper | 100,51 \nmm] \n\nSubsequently: \n▪ Read the measurement result on the display (digital caliper) or scale (analog caliper). \n▪ Record the measurement result.\n\nFAQ RoboRail \nMeasurement instructions \n\nPage 5/10 version 0.0 | 2-5-2024 \n2.2 Protractor \n\nA protractor is an instrument that you use to measure angles of the material.\n\nPreferred tool: \ndigital \n\nProtractor with a rated accuracy of 0,1° (0.1°) \nAlternative tool: \nanalog \n\n \nImages: examples of a digital and analog protractor \n\nHow to use a protractor \n\n➢ If you use a digital protractor, also refer to the user manual of your specific type. \n➢ Make sure that you use a protractor of an appropriate length.\n\nTo measure the angle of a material or cut ( Image 4 |  Image 5): \n▪ Line up the vertex of the angle with the dot at the center of the protractor. \n▪ Line up one side of the angle with 0° on the protractor. \n▪ Read the protractor to see where the other side of the angle crosses the number scale. \n▪ Record the measurement result.\n\nImage 4 Angle measurement [digital \nprotractor | 90,5°] \nImage 5 Angle measurement [analog \nprotractor | 86°] \n\n2.3 Tape measure \n\nA tape measure is a flexible ruler that you use to measure: \n- the distance between two opposite sites of a material or cut \n- the length of a material or cut \n- the size of a material \n\nIt is applicable to measure cutting sizes and material with a length of 0,3 to 12 m (1 to 40 ft).\n\nFAQ RoboRail \nMeasurement instructions \n\nPage 6/10 version 0.0 | 2-5-2024 \nPreferred tool \n\nTape measure Class I according to EU Directive 2014/32/EU \n\nClass I allows a tolerance over the entire length of: \n0,3 mm at 2 m | 0,4 mm at 3 m | 0,6 mm at 5 m | \n0,9 mm at 8 m | 1,1 mm at 10 m \n\nFor USA: \nMake sure that you use a tape measure with the highest \navailable accuracy for professional use, with a permitted \ntolerance over the entire length of max. 1/16” at 33 ft.\n\nImage: example of a retractable tape measure \n\nHow to use a tape measure \n\n➢ The temperature range for use of the tape measure is 20°C ± 8°C (54 to 82°F). Do not exceed this range \nto prevent measurement errors due to shrink or expansion of the tape. \n➢ The hook at the end of the tape is ‘floating’ to provide both inside and outside measurements that are \naccurate. \n➢ The thumb lock is used to keep the tape in place at the desired length and stops it from automatically \nretracting back into its housing \n➢ Tape measures are available with a metric and/or an imperial scale; \n- metric markings are displayed in mm, cm and m \n- imperial markings are displayed in feet (F), inches and fractions of inches \n\nTo measure the inside of a material or cut ( Image 6): \n▪ Put the hook at the inside of the material that you intend to measure. \n▪ Extend the tape to the opposite site of the material or cut and lock it.\n\nImage 6 Inside measurement with \ntape measure [29 mm] \n\nTo measure the outside of a material ( Image 7): \n▪ Put the hook at the outside of the material that you intend to measure. \n▪ Extend the tape to the opposite site of the material and lock it.\n\nTAPE \nTHUMB LOCK \nHOOK \n\nFAQ RoboRail \nMeasurement instructions \n\nPage 7/10 version 0.0 | 2-5-2024 \n\nImage 7 Outside measurement with \ntape measure [10,5 mm] \n\nSubsequently: \n▪ Read the measurement result on the tape. \n▪ Record the measurement result. \n▪ Unlock the tape.\n\nFAQ RoboRail \nMeasurement instructions \n\nPage 8/10 version 0.0 | 2-5-2024 \n3. Measurements & data collection \n\n3.1 Measurements \n\nThe material that you measure must be free of burrs and slags to get accurate measurement results. \n\n▪ If necessary, remove burrs and/or slags from the material. \n▪ Measure the material(s) and/or cut(s) as specified by HGG. According to the size and shape of material, \nuse one of the tools as described in this document. \n\n➢ To measure round and rectangular tubes/pipes, make sure to take the centerline distance ( Image 8).\n\nThis is the distance related to the exact center of the material.\n\nImage 8 Centerline of a round and \nrectangular tube/pipe \n\n➢ To measure channels, flat bars and angles, take the longest length of the material/cut. \n\n3.2 Diagnostic data collection \n\nIn addition to the measurement results, HGG needs a download of relevant files. These data are necessary to \nexamine the cause of the cutting problem.\n\nOn the screen do the procedure that follows: \n▪ In the Advanced menu: select Generate data collection (extension .7z). \n▪ In the Description box: enter the following information as complete as possible: \n- the machine number; you can find this number on the type plate of the RoboRail \n- a description of what went wrong \n- when the problem started \n- any other information that may be useful to HGG to solve the problem \n▪ In the Additional files box: add additional cutting files* from external applications. \n\n* Cutting files such as: ProCAM project (.pcd) | DSTV files (.dstv) | NC Data (.nc1) \n\nYou can do this in two ways: \n- Use the Add button and select the files with which there is a cutting problem; or \n- Drag and drop the files from and external application. \n▪ Select Create Collection.\n\nSubsequently: \n▪ Take/collect one or more clear pictures of: \n- error messages on the screen \n- the material or cut with which there is a cutting problem \n\nFAQ RoboRail \nMeasurement instructions \n\nPage 9/10 version 0.0 | 2-5-2024 \n▪ Collect drawings and/or design files of the material with which there is a cutting problem. \n▪ Make an even more extensive description of the cutting problem, if applicable.\n\nNow you are ready to send the downloaded and collected files to HGG. You can do this in several ways: \n- Use an FTP server. \n- Use a free File Transfer Protocol server. HGG recommends to use WeTransfer (https://wetransfer.com/). \n\n \n Select and add the collected files; or \nSelect Or select a folder to add a folder with the collected files \n Enter service@hgg.nl \n Enter your own email address \n Enter your machine number \n Enter a short message or the name of your contact person at HGG \n Select Transfer \n\nPlease do not send your files by email, because: \n- most email firewalls will block unrecognized file formats \n- most emails have a data limit of 10 MB or 15 MB \n\n▪ Send the collected file to the HGG technical service department in the preferred way.\n\nFAQ RoboRail \nMeasurement instructions \n\nPage 10/10 version 0.0 | 2-5-2024 \nMetal profiles | shapes \n\n \nRound tube/pipe Rectangular tube Channel Flat bar Angle",
