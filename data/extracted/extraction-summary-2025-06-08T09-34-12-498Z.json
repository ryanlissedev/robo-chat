A desiccant should be used in the control unit cabinets and \nother electrical components (in the event of extended storage change the desiccant regularly). Ven�late the \narea periodically. The floor should also be damp proof or damp-proof padding should be laid before storage.\n\nMost parts of the machine are painted or coated to prevent rus�ng. However, some parts are exposed to the \nair and should be oiled or greased regularly for protec�on. Alterna�vely, spray the parts with oil and seal with \nplas�c coa�ng (in the event of extended storage check the parts regularly). Treat all exposed parts, pay \npar�cular aten�on to the conveyor rollers, the cylinder sha�s and the infeed and ou�eed storage.\n\nAll hoses and cables should be shielded by protec�ve covering to prevent damage.\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual \n\n \nPage 19/62 version 2.1 | 24-4-2024 \n5 Infeed table \n\nThe infeed table consists of sliders with arms to cut larger quan��es of the same profiles in quick succession.\n\nSeveral profiles can be placed on the side load infeed table, which are straightened by the driven chains and \narms. The sliders move one profile and place it on the bogies. Once over the bogies, the sliders lower, leaving \nthe profile on the bogies, retrac�ng the arms and return to their home posi�on.\n\nThe conveyor can be controlled from the touch screen on the remote control, either in the material handling \nscreen by selec�ng the conveyor or in the diagnos�cs screen under the conveyor tab.\n\nSlider and Arm Star�ng posi�on: Infeed table is homed and arms are up.\n\nLoad profiles approximately 4 inches (10 cm) apart.\n\nPress Infeed on the remote control: chains with \nmaterial will move toward the arm.\n\nThe sliders will bring the profiles into a straight \nposi�on.\n\nThe sliders move the material above the bogies.\n\nThe bogies come up.\n\nArms rectract and sliders return to home. Profile ready for clamping.\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual \n\n \nPage 20/62 version 2.1 | 24-4- 2024 \n6 Opera�on \n\n6.1 Before star�ng the machine, check that: \n• All persons are clear of the machine. \n• No maintenance work is being performed on the machine. \n• All fixed covers are in place. Some can be removed for cleaning, lubrica�on and maintenance. \n• The machine is free of jams and other obstacles. \n\n \n6.2 Star�ng up the machine \nThe opera�on of the machine is divided into 4 phases: \n\nIn order use the machine for profiling the operator must go through these 4 phases from le� to right. The \nmachine starts up automa�cally. If an ac�on is required, the machine will show this, with addi�onal \ninstruc�ons, if needed. The buton at the botom center of the screen is always the next step. It’s appearance \nwill change accordingly to the state of the machine. The user interface will only display butons that are \nallowed to be clicked in that specific state to prevent confusion.\n\nAll 4 phases are described below and the steps that need to be taken are divided into 2 types. \n1. Manual (M), an ac�on is required from the operator (Orange). \n2. Automa�c (A), the machine performs this ac�on automa�cally (Blue).\n\nNOTE! The images used to visualize the user interface do not show the whole func�onality of the interface \nand are primarily used as a guideline. Always assume that the given descrip�on below describes the ac�ons \nthat need to be taken.\n\nPowering \non mode\nHoming \nmode\nPreparing \nmode\nProfiling \nmode\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual \n\n \nPage 21/62 version 2.1 | 24-4- 2024 \n6.2.1 Powering on mode \nIn ‘powering on mode’ the machine connects to the mo�on controller and perform several configura�on \nchecks on both hard- and so�ware level to assure correct opera�on.\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual \n\n \nPage 22/62 version 2.1 | 24-4- 2024 \n6.2.2 Homing mode \nIn homing mode the machine is calibrated. The steps that need to be performed when the machine has had a \ncomplete power-down differ from the steps that need to be performed when the machine has been running \nin idle. \n\n \n\n* Visually monitor the arm because the movement is unsafe and is not restricted in the way in which it moves \nto its position. \n** When the machine has not had complete power-down and it has already been homed, the homing \nsteps are skipped automatically. \n*** Use the move, rotate, open and close buttons on the right of the screen to remove previous materials.\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual \n\n \nPage 23/62 version 2.1 | 24-4- 2024 \n6.2.3 Preparing mode \nIn preparing mode the machine calculates the cu�ng file. The machine sets the bogies to the appropriate \nheight and the operator places the material on the bogies. The operator is also responsible for preparing the \nroller yaws. Another op�on is to eject the remnant when the operator wants to use a different material or \njust clear the machine from the material of the previous job. This is possible via the ‘Eject remnant’ buton.\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual \n\n \nPage 24/62 version 2.1 | 24-4- 2024 \n\n* When a material is used which uses the same \nbogie height, this step is skipped to save �me. \n** Make sure the material is always placed on the \nfront bogie. \n*** The material should be moved to a posi�on \nwhere it meets the (imaginary) red line in the \nimage below.\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual \n\n \nPage 25/62 version 2.1 | 24-4-2024 \n6.2.4 Profiling mode \nIn profiling mode the machine is ready to start profiling. The operator can select between automatic and \n(semi) automatic profiling and step mode and is able to select different cuts.\n\nWARNING!\n\nCRUSHING, WEDGING, BURNING HAZARD \nCell, Ou�eed table \nHeavy and hot parts can fall onto the infeed table or the \nfloor during the final cut and injure. The ou�eed table might \nmove into the cell to catch a part and slides back again. Do \nnot approach the table while the machine is s�ll cu�ng.\n\nProvide a non-flammable container to catch the parts. Wait \nun�l parts have cooled down. These may be hot and sharp.\n\nWear the advised PPE.\n\nWARNING!\n\nFIRE HAZARD \nDebris in material to be cut \nWood, waste or packing material in a tube or profile can \ncatch fire and set the machine on fire. Check each profile \nbefore loading it on the machine and remove any debris.\n\nWARNING!\n\nFALL HAZARD \nInfeed table, machine frame \nTripping or losing one's balance on top of the infeed table or \nthe machine frame. Use a rope or tool while loading. Do not \nstand on the infeed table or machine frame.\n\nWARNING!\n\nCRUSHING, WEDGING HAZARD \nInfeed table, trolley, bogies, chuck \nWhile loading material in the trolley personnel can get \nfingers or hands crushed in the trolley or front chuck \nbetween material and the jaws. Use tools to posi�on the \nmaterial. Wear the advised PPM to avoid injury.\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual \n\n \nPage 26/62 version 2.1 | 24-4- 2024 \n\n \n• Automa�c mode, automa�cally perform the preparing approaching, profiling and retrac�ng steps for \nall cuts. Operator only clicks ‘finish profiling’ on the botom centre of the screen a�er profiling is \nfinished. \n• Semi-automa�c mode, perform the preparing, approaching, profiling and retrac�ng steps for one cut \nat a �me. Operator clicks ‘next cut’ a�er each cut and ‘finish profiling’ once all cuts are finished. \n• Step mode, operator must press ‘next step’ a�er preparing, approaching, profiling and retrac�ng. \n• Select cut, allows the operator to select a specific cut in the lists of cuts visible in the middle of the \nscreen. \n• Finish profiling takes the operator back to preparing mode. \n• Move cut, allows the operator to manually change the torch posi�on . \n• Move material, allows the operator to move the material forward or backward and to retract the \nrobot arm. \n• Open ou�eed table dialog, allows the operator to �lt, raise, retract and extend the ou�eed table \nmanually. \n• Retract, retracts the robot arm. \n• Dry run performs profiling without cu�ng.\n\nRoboRail Operator’s manual \n\n \nPage 27/62 version 2.1 | 24-4-2024 \n\n7 Conver�ng to a different profile \n\n \nClamp your profiles using the appropriate accessories for the front chuck and rear chuck (trolley) mounted in \nthe correct position. Tube and box sections can be clamped from the inside or from the outside.\n\nOperation conveyor mode check \n\nWhen cutting angle, channel, flatbar you must cut in conveyor mode. When preparing the machine, a check \nwill be performed on the loaded file. If it is one of these materials, the machine checks if the conveyor mode \nplate is present and if the outfeed table is at its highest position.\n\nIf it is not, the machine will ask to place the plate and to raise the table.\n\nWhen loading a file with tube/square tube, the check will ask you to remove the plate and send the table \ndown.\n\nIf you raise the table itself again with a tube/square tube and then go to cut a larger profile, the table will be \nsent down again so that you can't bump into the table with the material.\n\nPossible Jaw Moun�ng Posi�ons on the Rear Chuck or trolley: \n\n \nProfile Min.
