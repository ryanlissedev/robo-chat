3.2 Tool calibration of the robot 

Tool calibration makes sure that the robot exactly knows the position of the torch, including the distance of 
the torch above the material. This calibration procedure can be important if the torch is bent due to the heat 
of the cutting process.

Before you start: 
▪ Make sure that there is no material inside the cutting cell. 
▪ Make sure that you have equipped the torch with 125 A consumables ( Image 3). 
(Consumables of 65 A are 3 mm too short for calibration purposes.) 
▪ Make sure that the cutting cell is closed.

In case of large cutting faults (>10 mm / ⅜”) before calibration:
