Summary : This figure shows two photographs of a digital caliper being used to measure the outside dimensions of a rusted metal bracket, with the measured values displayed on the caliper screens and annotated below each image.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Two side-by-side close-up photographs of a hand holding a digital caliper measuring the outside dimensions of a rusted metal bracket.
  • The left image is labeled "Image 2" and the right image is labeled "Image 3".
  • Both images are taken from an oblique angle, showing the caliper jaws in contact with the bracket and the digital display facing the camera.
  • The background is a light-colored surface, possibly a workbench or sheet of paper.

Technical Details :
  • The digital caliper display in Image 2 reads "35.51 mm".
  • The digital caliper display in Image 3 reads "100.51 mm".
  • Each image is annotated below with the following text:
    – Image 2: "Outside measurement [digital caliper | 35,51 mm]"
    – Image 3: "Outside measurement [digital caliper | 100,51 mm]"
  • The caliper is a standard digital model with a metallic finish and a thumb wheel for adjustment.

Spatial Relationships :
  • In both images, the caliper is held in the foreground, with the bracket positioned between the jaws.
  • The left image (Image 2) shows a smaller dimension being measured compared to the right image (Image 3), as indicated by the caliper readings and the visible jaw opening.
  • The hand holding the caliper is visible in the lower part of each image, providing scale.

Analysis :
  • The photographs document two different outside measurements of the same or similar metal bracket, with the measured values clearly displayed and annotated.
  • The use of a digital caliper ensures precise measurement, and the images serve as visual evidence of the recorded dimensions (35.51 mm and 100.51 mm).
  • The rust and wear on the bracket are visible, indicating it is likely a used or aged component. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.541,r=0.578,b=0.832), with ID 2dc5a84f-1453-48ee-a0b8-fa280b5016a3 -->

Scene Overview :
  • The left image (Image 4) shows a close-up of a person using a digital protractor to measure the angle of a metal bracket, with the digital display reading 90.5°.
  • The right image (Image 5) depicts a hand holding an analog protractor against a metal object, with the analog scale indicating an angle of 86°.
  • Both images focus on the measurement process and the tools in use, with metal parts and brackets visible in the background.

Technical Details :
  • Image 4: Digital protractor with a clear electronic display showing "90.5°"; the user is wearing gloves.
  • Image 5: Analog protractor with a semicircular scale; the measured value is marked at "86°".
  • No scale bars or additional measurement references are present.

Spatial Relationships :
  • In both images, the protractors are positioned at the intersection of two metal surfaces, emphasizing the angle being measured.
  • The digital protractor is oriented horizontally, while the analog protractor is held vertically.

Analysis :
  • The figure contrasts the use of digital and analog protractors for angle measurement, highlighting the precision and readability differences (digital: 90.5°, analog: 86°).
  • The digital protractor provides a more precise, easily readable value, while the analog protractor requires manual reading from the scale. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.091,t=0.598,r=0.579,b=0.759), with ID 360c9267-8461-4dfa-b78d-bc46127ea400 -->

- **How to use a tape measure**
- The temperature range for use of the tape measure is **20°C ± 8°C** (54 to 82°F). Do **not** exceed this range to prevent measurement errors due to shrink or expansion of the tape.
- The hook at the end of the tape is ‘floating’ to provide both inside and outside measurements that are accurate.
- The thumb lock is used to keep the tape in place at the desired length and stops it from automatically retracting back into its housing
- Tape measures are available with a metric and/or an imperial scale;
  - metric markings are displayed in mm, cm and m
  - imperial markings are displayed in feet (F), inches and fractions of inches <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.330,r=0.899,b=0.525), with ID 5f9eed46-09d1-47fa-b42a-ea5aadd18454 -->

- To measure the inside of a material or cut (◆ Image 6):
  - Put the hook at the inside of the material that you intend to measure.
  - Extend the tape to the opposite site of the material or cut and lock it. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.536,r=0.652,b=0.594), with ID ff9becb4-cdfa-44ee-ba0b-e250946e2c0e -->

Summary : This is a logo featuring the letters "HGG" in white on a blue square background, with a stylized gray elliptical shape containing a white circle overlapping the lower portion of the square.

logo: HGG

Design Elements :
  • Large white uppercase letters "HGG" centered within a solid blue square.
  • A gray elliptical shape with a white circular cutout overlaps the lower part of the blue square, extending outside the square's bottom edge.
  • No additional text, tagline, or company name visible.

Dimensions & Placement :
  • Blue square occupies the majority of the image area.
  • Elliptical shape is positioned diagonally, with its center below the "G" and its left edge extending beyond the square.

Analysis :
  • The logo uses a simple, modern design with a strong color contrast (blue, white, gray).
  • The elliptical shape may suggest motion, technology, or a stylized object, but no explicit meaning is provided in the image. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.023,r=0.192,b=0.113), with ID b3533ce7-71e0-4030-a260-62e58b99d3db -->

Summary : This illustration shows five common metal profile shapes, each represented by a blue outline and labeled with its corresponding name.

illustration:
# Metal Profile Shapes :
  • Round tube/pipe: Depicted as a blue-outlined circle.
  • Rectangular tube: Depicted as a blue-outlined rectangle with rounded corners.
  • Channel: Depicted as a blue-outlined "C" shape.
  • Flat bar: Depicted as a blue vertical rectangle.
  • Angle: Depicted as a blue-outlined "L" shape.

# Labels :
  • Each shape is labeled below with its name: "Round tube/pipe", "Rectangular tube", "Channel", "Flat bar", and "Angle".

# Design Encodings :
  • All shapes are rendered in a consistent blue color.
  • Simple, schematic representations with no additional dimensions or measurements.

# Layout :
  • Shapes are arranged horizontally in a single row, each with its label directly beneath.

Analysis :
  • The illustration provides a clear visual reference for identifying and distinguishing between five standard metal profile cross-sections, useful for engineering, construction, or manufacturing contexts. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.120,r=0.863,b=0.239), with ID 3dbf6c14-bca2-4a40-9cce-f4770844721f -->
