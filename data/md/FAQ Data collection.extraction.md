Whenever there is a problem on your RoboRail machine, our technical support team is always ready to help you. Our team has several diagnostic tools at their disposal. To help you successfully it is very important that the following information is as complete as possible. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.111,t=0.065,r=0.886,b=0.178), with ID 5e4336f2-482a-4d77-a8bf-e11c8602e221 -->

Summary : This image is a screenshot showing the first step in a process for generating data collection in a software interface, specifically by navigating to the "Advanced" menu and selecting "Generate data collection." The screenshot includes a highlighted dropdown menu, a process flow diagram, and various control buttons.

screenshot:  
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is a software interface for an HGG system, with a dark background and several UI elements.
  • The top left shows a dropdown menu under "Advanced," with "Generate data collection" highlighted in red.
  • The center displays a horizontal process flow diagram with circular nodes, starting from "Machine started" to "Infeed homed" and continuing through several steps.
  • The HGG logo is visible on the left side.
  • The right side contains multiple rectangular control buttons, such as "Move robot arm to in," "Move robot arm to left," "Move robot arm to right," and others.
  • The bottom bar includes status indicators and a "Quit application" button.

Technical Details : 
  • No scale bar or magnification is present.
  • The dropdown menu includes options: "Advanced Dev," "Robot base calculator," "Profile correction," "Cutting Table," "PowerMax Dialog," "Generate data collection," "Press Plate," "Force user maintenance mode," and "Maintenance mode."
  • The process flow diagram nodes are: "Machine started," "Infeed homed," "Outfeed loaded," "Error check loaded," "Motor check loaded," and "Safety loaded."
  • The highlighted menu item is "Generate data collection."

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The dropdown menu is in the upper left, overlaying the main interface.
  • The process flow diagram runs horizontally across the center.
  • Control buttons are grouped on the right, with status and navigation at the bottom.

Analysis : 
  • The screenshot visually instructs the user to access the "Generate data collection" function via the "Advanced" menu as the first step in a larger workflow.
  • The process flow diagram suggests a sequential workflow, with the current step ("Infeed homed") highlighted.
  • The interface is designed for stepwise operation, with clear navigation and control options for machine operation. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.187,r=0.805,b=0.448), with ID ffec53f6-a2f8-4742-b22b-4cf22a15636f -->

-  Step 2. Create data collection following the questions in the screen:
  - •  Machine number on the type plate,
  - •  Description of What went wrong,
  - •  When did the problem start,
  - •  Other information HGG might need <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.471,r=0.706,b=0.585), with ID 88885b05-b14e-498a-8051-d768b9b6d172 -->

Summary : This image is a screenshot showing steps in a software workflow for creating a data collection, specifically focusing on adding additional cutting files from external applications and then creating the collection.

screenshot:
Scene Overview : 
  • The main subject is a software dialog box titled "Create data collection".
  • The interface is dark-themed with white and blue text fields and buttons.
  • The screenshot is annotated with instructional steps: "Step 3. Add additional cutting files from external applications" at the top and "Step 4. Create collection" at the bottom.

Technical Details : 
  • The dialog box contains two main sections: "Description" and "Additional files".
  • The "Description" field includes a prompt: "Short description of what the machine was doing at the moment, if there has been maintenance recently, etc." and a sample input: "What went wrong, what is the machine number, when did the problem start, other information HGG might need".
  • The "Additional files" section instructs users to add files via the "Add" button or drag-and-drop, supporting file types such as ProCAM project (.pcd), DSTV files (.dstv), and NC Data (.nc1).
  • There are three buttons: "Add", "Remove", and "Create Collection", with "Cancel" as an option.

Spatial Relationships : 
  • The "Description" field is at the top, followed by the "Additional files" section.
  • Action buttons are aligned to the right and bottom of the dialog box.

Analysis : 
  • The screenshot visually guides users through the process of supplementing a data collection with external files and finalizing the collection, emphasizing the importance of detailed descriptions and relevant file attachments. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.596,r=0.751,b=0.891), with ID 4df7d854-9cd8-4d5b-a393-974e612daba1 -->

Send to HGG <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.114,t=0.065,r=0.238,b=0.086), with ID 00ad1927-7b7e-4a6e-9664-a1f30b4ff3b4 -->

You are now ready to send the information to HGG. We advise you to use an FTP server rather than email. Most email firewalls will block unrecognized file formats, also most emails have a data limit of 10 Mb or sometimes 15 Mb per email. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.113,t=0.096,r=0.864,b=0.156), with ID d12e74bb-7db0-4318-8e81-50d8b4909bdf -->

There are several free File Transfer Protocol servers available, HGG recommends
[WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com):

- • E mail to HGG: service@hgg.nl
- • Enter your own e-mail address
- • Enter your machine number in the ‘Message’ so that it can easily be identified by HGG.

Add your files. Click on the blue cross, browse to your files.
