logo: HGG

Summary : This is a logo consisting of the letters "HGG" in white on a blue square background, with a stylized grey elliptical disc featuring a central hole, partially overlapping the lower part of the square.

Design Elements :
  • The letters "HGG" are in a bold, sans-serif font, centered within a blue square.
  • A grey ellipse with a white circular hole is positioned diagonally, overlapping the lower left corner of the blue square.
  • The ellipse is rendered in a lighter grey, with the hole offset from the center.
  • No additional text, tagline, or company name is present.

Dimensions & Placement :
  • Blue square occupies the upper portion, with the ellipse extending beyond the lower left edge.
  • The letters "HGG" are horizontally aligned and evenly spaced within the square.

Analysis : 
  • The logo uses a simple, modern design with a strong geometric motif.
  • The blue and grey color scheme suggests professionalism and neutrality.
  • The elliptical disc with a central hole may symbolize a mechanical or industrial theme, but no explicit meaning is provided in the image. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.023,r=0.193,b=0.113), with ID 2d15ff98-2ee2-4071-98c5-8eaaa7c3d5d8 -->

**Alignment calibration of the chucks**

*You must do this calibration if the laser value during the* **Alignment calibration** *procedure changes more than 2 (mm).* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.195,r=0.908,b=0.268), with ID cb959f62-6a08-4154-aadd-31e75b28b9c2 -->

Necessary tools:

Allen key 3 mm   Some versions of the machine are attached with larger Allen screws or bolts. In that case you need another tool.

Wrench 24 <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.282,r=0.906,b=0.383), with ID 6ffda751-5147-4f38-b259-cbed64b2b99d -->

- To align the chucks, do the procedure that follows:
  - *The cover of the trolley is attached with 2x3 Allen screws with washers at the front (left + right) and 2x3 at the back (left + right) (◆ Image 1).*
  - Loosen the Allen screws (12 pcs) with the Allen key.
  - Remove the cover of the trolley. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.397,r=0.909,b=0.485), with ID 6a086323-7f9e-4ade-964e-e42c5d574997 -->

* _The rear chuck is attached with 2 bolts at both sides of the trolley. These are the bolts on the black plate (♦ Image 2)._
* Loosen the 4 bolts **slightly** with the wrench. Make sure not to turn the bolts out too far.
* This makes it possible to move the rear chuck manually.
* Inspect the alignment of the front and rear chuck visually.
* Slightly move the rear chuck to get it aligned with the front chuck. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.499,r=0.866,b=0.606), with ID fba3819e-7e7d-4f7a-9579-19900417039b -->

*The preferred movement is to* *slide* *the rear chuck horizontally. If you must* *turn* *the chuck to align it, make sure not to twist the chucks relative to each other to avoid distortion of the material. Turn the chuck* *carefully* *and only if necessary.* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.089,t=0.618,r=0.900,b=0.674), with ID ece4959c-e2d3-49a2-ba5b-02f2ad8f6322 -->

- • Make sure that the distance between the black plate and the orange material is equal over the entire length of the plate (◆ Image 3). This applies to the black plate on both sides of the trolley.
- • Use the switch [Y+] on the control panel of the trolley (or the arrow button ◀◀ on the screen) to move the trolley fully forward.
- • Keep an eye on the **Laser value** on the screen and move the trolley to the rear with switch [Y–] (or the arrow button ▶▶ on the screen). Make sure that the laser beam continues to hit the material. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.688,r=0.889,b=0.796), with ID fe9969cd-2ab7-4b58-9e3a-ba692931b027 -->

- If the laser value **increases**:
  - Move the rear chuck slightly to the left to align it with the front chuck.
  - Inspect the alignment of the front and rear chuck visually. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.809,r=0.648,b=0.865), with ID 6a13bcfd-b529-4354-a907-53156c5899ee -->

- If the laser value **decreases**:
  - Move the rear chuck slightly to the right to align it with the front chuck.
  - Inspect the alignment of the front and rear chuck visually. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.879,r=0.656,b=0.932), with ID 87785e11-6038-4178-bcac-663fe2703bc1 -->

logo: HGG

Design Elements : 
  • Large white uppercase letters "HGG" centered within a solid blue square.
  • A grey oval shape with a white circular cutout overlaps the lower portion of the blue square, extending beyond its bottom edge.
  • No additional text, tagline, or company name visible.

Dimensions & Placement : 
  • Blue square occupies the upper portion of the image.
  • Grey oval is diagonally oriented, partially outside the square, with the white circle near its center.

Analysis : 
  • The logo uses a simple, bold color scheme (blue, white, grey) and geometric shapes to create a modern, professional appearance. The oval and circle may suggest motion or focus, but no explicit meaning is conveyed beyond the stylized initials "HGG". <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.024,r=0.192,b=0.111), with ID 3a3fb96e-8744-4d3b-a795-c44e0bedae6d -->

Scene Overview :
  • Three close-up color photographs of an orange and black industrial machine, arranged left to right.
  • Each image is annotated with arrows, circles, or dashed lines to highlight specific hardware or alignment features.
  • Lighting is even, with clear focus on mechanical details.

Technical Details :
  • Image 1: Shows one set of three Allen screws (out of a total of 12) on the orange machine housing, with white arrows pointing to their locations.
  • Image 2: Displays bolts located below the chuck on both sides, with a white oval encircling the relevant bolts.
  • Image 3: Highlights the need for equal distance between a black plate and the orange material, using dashed lines and double-headed arrows to indicate the spacing.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Image 1: The Allen screws are positioned vertically on the side of the orange housing, adjacent to a metal rail.
  • Image 2: The bolts are situated beneath a large black cylindrical chuck, with the orange housing visible below.
  • Image 3: The black plate is mounted above the orange material, with bolts passing through and the spacing between components emphasized.

Analysis :
  • The figure systematically documents the locations and adjustment points for securing and aligning the machine’s chuck assembly.
  • Visual cues (arrows, circles, dashed lines) direct attention to critical fasteners and alignment requirements, supporting precise setup and maintenance.
  • The emphasis on equal spacing in Image 3 suggests the importance of parallel alignment for proper machine function. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.258,r=0.909,b=0.490), with ID 33ce6421-250a-4537-8b04-18f80b4060ef -->
