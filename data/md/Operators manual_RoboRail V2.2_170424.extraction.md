Summary : This figure explains the document conventions for indicating risk levels in a manual, using color-coded warning boxes with icons and explanatory text.

illustration:
# Risk Level Indicators :

• Two rectangular boxes, each with a triangular warning icon containing an exclamation mark.
• The top box is orange with a black triangle and exclamation mark.
• The bottom box is yellow with a black triangle and exclamation mark.

# Warning Box (Orange) :

• Label: "WARNING!"
• Description: "Indicates a hazard with a medium level of risk which, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury."
• Orange background signifies a higher level of risk compared to the yellow box.

# Caution Box (Yellow) :

• Label: "CAUTION!"
• Description: "Indicates a hazard with a low level of risk which, if not avoided, could result in minor or moderate injury or material damage."
• Yellow background signifies a lower level of risk.

# Analysis :

• The figure visually distinguishes between two risk levels—medium (warning) and low (caution)—using both color and iconography.
• The orange "WARNING!" box is associated with more severe consequences (death or serious injury), while the yellow "CAUTION!" box is for less severe outcomes (minor/moderate injury or material damage).
• The use of color and icon ensures quick recognition of risk severity in the manual. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.088,t=0.127,r=0.862,b=0.323), with ID 21d57a09-f67b-480f-8129-c49d991f2b78 -->

These boxes also specify:

- • *The nature and source of the risk*
- • *The consequences not avoiding the hazard*
- • *How to avoid the hazard* <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.336,r=0.480,b=0.430), with ID bd041a17-32d7-4fc3-8ec9-3e64b7aed86b -->

Summary : This flowchart outlines the step-by-step process for preparing and loading material onto a machine for a cutting operation, detailing both manual (M) and automated (A) actions.

flowchart:
# Nodes :
  • File selected (rectangle): "File selected (M), select a new cutting file by pressing the 'Open file' button on the bottom-center or use the last loaded cutting file by pressing the 'Open last loaded file' button."
  • File calculated (rectangle): "File calculated (A), the machine calculates the file in order to determine the cutting process."
  • Prepare rollers yaws (rectangle): "Prepare rollers yaws (M), select and install the appropriate yaws for the rear trolly."
  • Trolly at start position (rectangle): "Trolly at start position (M), move the trolly in a position that allows the material to be loaded on the bogies via the buttons on the screen or on the trolly (Y+ or Y-)."
  • Bogies raised (rectangle): "Bogies raised (A), the machine sets the bogies to the correct height."
  • Place material on infeed table (rectangle): "Place material on infeed table (M)."
  • Material placed on bogies (rectangle): "Material placed on bogies (M), place the material on the bogies**."
  • Press 'next infeed' button (rectangle): "Press 'next infeed' button."
  • Bogies finished (rectangle): "Bogies finished (M), Clamp the material with the knob on the rear chuck/trolley and move the material past the front chuck clamp.***"
  • Initialized (rectangle): "Initialized (M), press the 'Initialize' button."
  • Go to next state (rectangle): "Go to next state (A)."

# Connectors :
  • All nodes are connected sequentially with downward arrows, except after "Bogies raised (A)" where the flow splits into two parallel branches:
    – Left branch: "Place material on infeed table (M)" → "Press 'next infeed' button."
    – Right branch: "Material placed on bogies (M)" → "Bogies finished (M)" → "Initialized (M), press the 'Initialize' button."
  • Both branches converge at "Go to next state (A)."

# Layout :
  • The flowchart is arranged vertically, with a single linear sequence until "Bogies raised (A)", after which it splits into two parallel branches (left and right), then rejoins at the final node.
  • All nodes are rectangles with rounded corners.
  • Manual steps are marked with (M), automated steps with (A).

# Analysis :
  • The workflow alternates between manual and automated steps, clearly distinguishing operator actions from machine actions.
  • The process includes decision points for material placement, allowing for either infeed table or bogie loading, before converging to initialization and transition to the next state.
  • The structure ensures that all preparatory steps are completed before the machine proceeds, reducing the risk of errors in material handling and setup. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.121,r=0.432,b=0.936), with ID 67d446ac-2ec7-4efd-90ef-205b08927e7e -->

* When a material is used which uses the same bogie height, this step is skipped to save time.
** Make sure the material is always placed on the front bogie.
*** The material should be moved to a position where it meets the (imaginary) red line in the image below. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.474,t=0.115,r=0.859,b=0.243), with ID 08ac30b7-f49e-4eb9-930b-78399aaf0119 -->

Summary : This figure shows two photographs comparing the placement and reading of a spirit level on the top of two different chucks (front and rear) of a machine, with specific reference to the orientation of jaw number 4 on the front chuck.

photo:  

Scene Overview : 
  • The figure is split into two labeled images: Image 1 (left) and Image 2 (right).
  • Both images focus on the top surface of large cylindrical machine chucks, each with a spirit level and a metal straightedge placed across the top.
  • The setting appears to be an industrial or workshop environment, with machinery visible in the background of Image 2.

Technical Details : 
  • Image 1: The spirit level is placed on the front chuck, with jaw number 4 clearly marked and positioned at the top.
  • Image 2: The spirit level is placed on the rear chuck, with no specific jaw orientation indicated.
  • Both spirit levels show the bubble centered, indicating a level surface.
  • The straightedge in both images is labeled "Garavit" and has measurement markings.
  • On-image text: 
      – Image 1: "Level on top of the front chuck; jaw no. 4 on top"
      – Image 2: "Level on top of the rear chuck"

Spatial Relationships : 
  • In both images, the spirit level and straightedge are aligned horizontally across the top of the chucks.
  • In Image 1, jaw number 4 is visually highlighted with a white circle and the number "4".
  • The chucks are positioned centrally in each image, with the camera angle slightly above and to the side, providing a clear view of the level and jaw arrangement.

Analysis : 
  • The images are intended to document and compare the leveling of the front and rear chucks, with particular attention to the orientation of jaw number 4 on the front chuck.
  • Both chucks appear to be level as indicated by the centered bubbles in the spirit levels.
