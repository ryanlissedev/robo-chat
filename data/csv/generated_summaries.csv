CAUTION! WEDGING CRUSHING HAZARD FALLING MATERIAL, PARTS OR SCRAP Sharp and hot workpieces and scrap can fall out of the front chuck on and or/from the infeed table. Use non-ﬂammable containers for work pieces and scrap. Keep your distance and wear the recommended PPE.

WARNING HEALTH RISK, RISK OF SUFFOCATION The plasma cu�ng process may create hazardous substances. Cu�ng galvanized and stainless steel creates toxic gasses and pose a health risk. Remove these gases from the work ﬂoor and release them outside. Use a dust collector and change ﬁlters regularly. Keep the cell door closed and allow �me for gases to escape through the system. Do not inhale smoke. read the manual of the plasma unit for more informa�on.

CAUTION! HEARING DAMAGE The plasma cu�ng process generates noise emissions above 70 dB(A). Permanent hearing damage occurs with prolonged exposure. Hearing protec�on must be worn at all �mes.

WARNING! FIRE HAZARD Flammable materials in the vicinity of the machine The plasma cu�ng process generates high temperatures and sparks. Flammable and combus�ble materials may catch ﬁre. Never use the machine in a ﬂammable or explosive environment. Remove ﬂammable and combus�ble materials (oil, paint, etc.) from the vicinity of the machine and keep them at least 35 feet /10 meters away. Use a non- ﬂammable container for work pieces and scrap.

2.3 Please refer to the plasma unit manual for gas and compressed air requirements. 2.4 For safety reasons operators must wear:

Safety shoes. • Flame proof overall / clothing. • Flame proof gloves. • Ear protec�on. • Safety glasses. • Helmet (when using an overhead crane or entering the cell).

2.5 Make the area safe before cu�ng, remove all ﬂammable material within 35 feet /10 meters Keep a Co2 type ﬁre ex�nguisher nearby. Let hot metal cool down before handling it or let it touch combus�ble materials.

2.6 Gas cylinders contain a gas under high pressure, if damaged a cylinder can explode. Handle and use cylinders in accordance with applicable na�onal and local regula�ons.

Always:

Use only cylinders that are undamaged.

Use cylinders in an upright and secured posi�on.

Keep all gas equipment and parts in good condi�on, replace damaged or worn components.

Use gas equipment for only the type of gas they are designed and intended for

Never:

Lubricate gas- cylinders, -valves or -regulators with grease or oil.

Use tools to open a stuck cylinder.

2.7 The exhaust gases from the fume extraction and dust collection systems must be removed from the work floor according to local health and safety regulations. HGG recommends these gases be released to the exterior. When cutting stainless steel HGG STRONGLY advises that fumes are ALWAYS released outside*.

The material being cut can be a source of toxic fumes or gases that deplete oxygen. Exhaust gases pose a health risk when they are not removed from the work floor. Wait until the smoke has been extracted before opening the cell door.

To reduce the risk of exposure to fumes:

Remove all solvents from the metal before cutting. • Use local exhaust ventilation to remove fumes from the air. • Do not inhale fumes, wait a while to open the door to give fumes the time to leave the cell. • Monitor or test the air quality at the site as needed.

Consult with a local expert to implement a site plan to make sure air quality is safe.

4 Storage

4.1 Storing the machine when it will not be used for an extended period of �me

If for any reason the machine needs to be moved to a new loca�on or decommissioned and placed in storage, please contact HGG for detailed advice. 4.2 Storage environment For long term storage the machine should be placed in a moisture and damp free environment with an ambient temperature between 5°C and 40°C. A desiccant should be used in the control unit cabinets and other electrical components (in the event of extended storage change the desiccant regularly). Ven�late the area periodically. The ﬂoor should also be damp proof or damp-proof padding should be laid before storage.

Most parts of the machine are painted or coated to prevent rus�ng. However, some parts are exposed to the air and should be oiled or greased regularly for protec�on. Alterna�vely, spray the parts with oil and seal with plas�c coa�ng (in the event of extended storage check the parts regularly). Treat all exposed parts, pay par�cular aten�on to the conveyor rollers, the cylinder sha�s and the infeed and ou�eed storage. All hoses and cables should be shielded by protec�ve covering to prevent damage.

The infeed table consists of sliders with arms to cut larger quan��es of the same proﬁles in quick succession. Several proﬁles can be placed on the side load infeed table, which are straightened by the driven chains and arms. The sliders move one proﬁle and place it on the bogies. Once over the bogies, the sliders lower, leaving the proﬁle on the bogies, retrac�ng the arms and return to their home posi�on.

The conveyor can be controlled from the touch screen on the remote control, either in the material handling screen by selec�ng the conveyor or in the diagnos�cs screen under the conveyor tab.

Operation conveyor mode check

When cutting angle, channel, flatbar you must cut in conveyor mode. When preparing the machine, a check will be performed on the loaded file. If it is one of these materials, the machine checks if the conveyor mode plate is present and if the outfeed table is at its highest position.

If it is not, the machine will ask to place the plate and to raise the table.

When loading a file with tube/square tube, the check will ask you to remove the plate and send the table down.

If you raise the table itself again with a tube/square tube and then go to cut a larger profile, the table will be sent down again so that you can't bump into the table with the material.

RoboRail Operator’s manual

Make sure the Plasma unit power is OFF before changing consumables. • Use the provided tools when replacing torch parts. • Do not tighten parts excessively, they will be heated during cutting, expand and become tighter,

making them difficult to remove.

• When plasma cutting with oxygen it is important to keep the consumable free from grease and oil. Always wear gloves when replacing these consumables, the oils in your skin may cause damage to the consumables or the torch!

8.4 Preven�ve Maintenance

Periodic maintenance is necessary to ensure the reliability and safe operation of the machine. It is very important to keep the machine in perfect condition to: • maintain the high quality of the cutting work • have a minimum of down time • work safely with the machine

9.2 Alignment calibra�on of the chucks

Calibration of the chucks makes sure that the front and rear chucks are aligned with each other. If they are not aligned, it can have a negative eﬀect on the cutting quality.

The RoboRail is supplied with a tube (L = 2 m, 120 x 120 mm*) as reference part. If this tube is not available anymore, you must take an alternative square tube – with very accurate dimensions – that you use as a reference part. Dimensions of the alternative tube: min. 120 x 120 mm | max. 200 x 200 mm*

* For USA:

dimensions of the reference tube are L = 7 ft, 4 x 8”, thickness = ⅛” - dimensions of an alternative tube must be min. min. 5 x 5” / max. 8 x 8”

To verify if alignment of the front and rear chucks is necessary, do the procedure that follows: Select Con�nue.

If you use the reference tube supplied with the RoboRail: ** Enter proﬁle width: 120,00 (mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). Enter proﬁle height: 120,00 (mm) on the screen (or use the arrow keys to do so). Enter Submit values.

** For USA, if you did not receive the square tube but the 4 x 8” tube or if you did not receive any tube:

skip this instruction and continue with the next (“If you use an alternative square tube:”) - enter the dimensions in mm (1” = 25.4 mm)

Select Finish.

If the laser value changes more than 2 (mm) you must align the chucks.

For the procedure to align the chucks: Contact the HGG service department.

9.3 Base calibra�on of the robot

Base calibration makes sure that the 0 point of the robot is actually the 0 point. It sets the correct position of the robot related to the entire system.

The RoboRail is supplied with a tube (L = 2 m, 120 x 120 mm*) as reference part. If this tube is not available anymore, you must take an alternative square tube – with very accurate dimensions – that you use as a reference part. Dimensions of the alternative tube: min. 120 x 120 mm | max. 200 x 200 mm*

For USA:

dimensions of the reference tube are L = 7 ft, 4 x 8”, thickness = ⅛” - dimensions of an alternative tube must be min. (min. 5 x 5” / max. 8 x 8”)

Tool calibration makes sure that the robot exactly knows the position of the torch, including the distance of the torch above the material. This calibration procedure can be important if the torch is bent due to the heat of the cutting process.

Before you start: Make sure that there is no material inside the cu�ng cell. Make sure that you have equipped the torch with 125 A consumables ( Image 3).

(Consumables of 65 A are 3 mm too short for calibration purposes.)

Make sure that the cu�ng cell is closed.

In case of large cu�ng faults (>10 mm / ⅜”) before calibra�on: Put the robot in Slow mode (botom le� of the screen) so you can stop it before it hits the sensor or the

Image: example of a retractable tape measure

How to use a tape measure

➢ The temperature range for use of the tape measure is 20°C ± 8°C (54 to 82°F). Do not exceed this range to prevent measurement errors due to shrink or expansion of the tape.

➢ The hook at the end of the tape is ‘floating’ to provide both inside and outside measurements that are accurate.

➢ The thumb lock is used to keep the tape in place at the desired length and stops it from automatically retracting back into its housing

➢ Tape measures are available with a metric and/or an imperial scale;

metric markings are displayed in mm, cm and m -

imperial markings are displayed in feet (F), inches and fractions of inches

3 Perform a base calibration

To perform a base calibration you will need a square tube with very accurate dimensions. Preferably the provided calibration tube.

Next you will need to follow the instructions on the calibration dialog.

4 Perform a tool calibration

To perform the tool calibration please follow the instructions on the calibration in the calibration dialog.

Make sure the tool sensor cover is removed before starting the calibration. Also make sure the 125Amp consumables are mounted.

When doing the calibration keep an eye on where the laser hits the tool. Make sure the laser hits the black part of the tool and not the white part.

5 Verify the calibration

5.1 Verify base z

• To verify the base Z offset, program a square tube in ProCAM preferably use the provided calibration

dialog. Load the generated file in the software and apparoach the material.

• Using an allenkey measure the distance between the torch and the material. • •

Look into the current cutting table what the height should be. If the height is not correct adjust: machine calibration->robot base->Z. until the height is correct.

5.2 Verify conveyor Z

Change the machine to conveyor mode. • Program a channel with the dimensions of the used calibration material. • • Measure the distance between the torch and the material with an allenkey. • •

Look into the current cutting table what the height should be. If it is not correct adjust: bogies-> centerline Z offset. Until the height is correct

5.3 Verify base X

Using the same file as in verify conveyor Z approach the material on the sides • • Measure the distance on both sides, if the distance is not the same adjust: machine calibration->robot

base->x until it is the same.

If the distance on both sides is too small, the tool calibration should be done over. Also base Z will need to be reviewed after doing the tool calibration.

Alignment calibration of the chucks

You must do this calibration if the laser value during the Alignment calibration procedure changes more than 2 (mm).

Necessary tools:

Allen key 3 mm      Wrench 24  

        

Some versions of the machine are attached with larger Allen screws or bolts. In that case you need another tool.

To align the chucks, do the procedure that follows: The cover of the trolley is attached with 2x3 Allen screws with washers at the front (left + right) and 2x3 at the back (left + right) ( Image 1). ▪ ▪ Remove the cover of the trolley.

The rear chuck is attached with 2 bolts at both sides of the trolley. These are the bolts on the black plate ( Image 2). ▪ ➢ This makes it possible to move the rear chuck manually. ▪ ▪ Slightly move the rear chuck to get it aligned with the front chuck.

The preferred movement is to slide the rear chuck horizontally. If you must turn the chuck to align it, make sure not to twist the chucks relative to each other to avoid distortion of the material. Turn the chuck carefully and only if necessary.

▪ Make sure that the distance between the black plate and the orange material is equal over the entire length of the plate ( Image 3). This applies to the black plate on both sides of the trolley.

▪ Use the switch [Y+] on the control panel of the trolley (or the arrow button on the screen) to move the trolley fully forward.

▪ Keep an eye on the Laser value on the screen and move the trolley to the rear with switch [Y‒] (or the arrow button on the screen). Make sure that the laser beam continues to hit the material.

If the laser value increases: ▪ Move the rear chuck slightly to the left to align it with the front chuck. ▪

If the laser value decreases: ▪ Move the rear chuck slightly to the right to align it with the front chuck. ▪
