Create diagnostic data collection 
Whenever there is a problem on your RoboRail machine, our technical support team is 
always ready to help you. Our team has several diagnostic tools at their disposal. To help 
you successfully it is very important that the following information is as complete as 
possible.

Step 1. Advanced, Generate data collection 

Step 2. Create data collection following the questions in the screen: 
• Machine number on the type plate, 
• Description of What went wrong, 
• When did the problem start, 
• Other information HGG might need 
Step 3. Add additional cutting files from external applications 
Step 4. Create collection 

Send to HGG 
You are now ready to send the information to HGG. We advise you to use an FTP server 
rather than email. Most email firewalls will block unrecognized file formats, also most 
emails have a data limit of 10 Mb or sometimes 15 Mb per email.

There are several free File Transfer Protocol servers available, HGG recommends 
WeTransfer: 
• E mail to HGG: service@hgg.nl 
• Enter your own e-mail address 
• Enter your machine number in the ‘Message’ so that it can 
easily be identified by HGG.

Add your files. Click on the blue cross, browse to your files.
