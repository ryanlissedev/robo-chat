2 Safety 

2.1 Personal safety instruc�ons 

Check the machine as required to make sure it is in safe opera�ng condi�on. When found to be in incapable 
of safe opera�on the machine must be withdrawn from service. Do not work with the machine if it is 
damaged or not in good working condi�on. Qualified personnel must repair the machine prior to its next use.

Stop the machine in such a way that another worker is unable to start the machine when you must work on or 
in the machine.

Only reach into the machine unless the machine is completely switched off.

The cell door cannot be opened during the cu�ng process. The window of the cu�ng cell has UV protec�on 
shield to protect your eyes. Never look directly at the torch during cu�ng, the bright light could damage your 
eyesig ht.

Always use the advised Personal Protec�on Equipment. Wear a helmet if material is being loaded using an 
overhead crane or a forkli�. 

2.2 Residual risks 
The machine is designed to be safe. Despite all risk reduc�on measures, care must always be taken when 
opera�ng the machine. Parts or machine components that are colored orange may move suddenly or 
unexpectedly. Some risks cannot be eliminated, the greatest poten�al residual risks are: 

• Wedging/crushing 
• Burning (skin injury) 
• Falling material 

 
CAUTION!

WEDGING, CRUSHING HAZARD 
Infeed table, machine frame, cell 
Personnel can be hit by the moving robot or material, burned 
by heat, affected by arc radia�on, fumes, sparks, noise and 
laser radia�on. Personnel can be drawn in or wedged. Keep 
the door of the cell closed during cu�ng. Stay behind the 
remote control as long as the machine is in opera�on. Do not 
approach the ou�eed or infeed table. Maintenance mode is 
for maintenance and trouble-shoo�ng purposes only. Do not 
step in or reach into the machine. Wear advised PPE.

CAUTION!

BURNING HAZARD 
HOT MATERIAL, COMPONENTS, PARTS OR SCRAP 
The plasma process g enerates high temperatures. Material 
coming out of the machine can be very hot. Components of 
the machine can be very hot. Give material and components 
of the machine �me to cool down before touching them.

Always wear boots and fireproof gloves when handling 
material or removing scrap pieces.

Page 6/62 version 2.1 | 24-4-2024 

CAUTION!

WEDGING CRUSHING HAZARD 
FALLING MATERIAL, PARTS OR SCRAP 
Sharp and hot workpieces and scrap can fall out of the front 
chuck on and or/from the infeed table. Use non-flammable 
containers for work pieces and scrap. Keep your distance and 
wear the recommended PPE.

WARNING 
HEALTH RISK, RISK OF SUFFOCATION 
The plasma cu�ng process may create hazardous 
substances. Cu�ng galvanized and stainless steel creates 
toxic gasses and pose a health risk. Remove these gases 
from the work floor and release them outside. Use a dust 
collector and change filters regularly. Keep the cell door 
closed and allow �me for gases to escape through the 
system. Do not inhale smoke. read the manual of the plasma 
unit for more informa�on.

CAUTION!

HEARING DAMAGE 
The plasma cu�ng process generates noise emissions above 
70 dB(A). Permanent hearing damage occurs with prolonged 
exposure. Hearing protec�on must be worn at all �mes.

WARNING!

FIRE HAZARD 
Flammable materials in the vicinity of the machine 
The plasma cu�ng process generates high temperatures 
and sparks. Flammable and combus�ble materials may 
catch fire. Never use the machine in a flammable or 
explosive environment. Remove flammable and combus�ble 
materials (oil, paint, etc.) from the vicinity of the machine 
and keep them at least 35 feet /10 meters away. Use a nonflammable container for work pieces and scrap.

WARNING!

FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARD 
Gas cylinders and torch 
Use gas cylinders responsibly according to na�onal and local 
regula�ons. Keep cylinders, valves, regulators torch and 
consumables free from grease or oil.

WARNING!

PLASMA AFFECTING MEDICAL IMPLANTS AND HEARING AIDS.

Magne�c fields from high currents can affect medical 
implants such as a pacemaker, insulin pump or hearing aid.

This can lead to a life-threatening situa�on. Wearers of 
these devices should consult a doctor before g oing near a 
plasma arc.

2.3 Gas and compressed air supplies 
Please refer to the plasma unit manual for gas and compressed air requirements. 
2.4 Personal Protec�on Equipment 
For safety reasons operators must wear: 

• Safety shoes. 
• Flame proof overall / clothing. 
• Flame proof g loves. 
• Ear protec�on. 
• Safety glasses. 
• Helmet (when using an overhead crane or entering the cell). 
2.5 Fire preven�on 
Make the area safe before cu�ng, remove all flammable material within 35 feet /10 meters Keep a 
Co2 type fire ex�nguisher nearby. Let hot metal cool down before handling it or let it touch 
combus�ble materials. 
2.6 Explosion preven�on 
Gas cylinders contain a gas under high pressure, if damaged a cylinder can explode. Handle and 
use cylinders in accordance with applicable na�onal and local regula�ons.

Always: 
Use only cylinders that are undamaged.

Use cylinders in an upright and secured posi�on.

Keep all gas equipment and parts in good condi�on, replace damaged or worn components.

Use gas equipment for only the type of gas they are designed and intended for 
Never: 
Lubricate gas- cylinders, -valves or -regulators with grease or oil.

Use tools to open a stuck cylinder. 
2.7 Ven�la�on 
The exhaust gases from the fume extraction and dust collection systems must be removed from the work floor 
according to local health and safety regulations. HGG recommends these gases be released to the exterior.

When cutting stainless steel HGG STRONGLY advises that fumes are ALWAYS released outside*.

The material being cut can be a source of toxic fumes or gases that deplete oxygen. Exhaust gases pose a 
health risk when they are not removed from the work floor. Wait until the smoke has been extracted before 
opening the cell door.

To reduce the risk of exposure to fumes: 
• Remove all solvents from the metal before cutting. 
• Use local exhaust ventilation to remove fumes from the air. 
• Do not inhale fumes, wait a while to open the door to give fumes the time to leave the cell. 
• Monitor or test the air quality at the site as needed.

Consult with a local expert to implement a site plan to make sure air quality is safe.

4 Storage 

4.1 Storing the machine when it will not be used for an extended period of �me 

If for any reason the machine needs to be moved to a new loca�on or decommissioned and placed in 
storage, please contact HGG for detailed advice. 
4.2 Storage environment 
For long term storage the machine should be placed in a moisture and damp free environment with an 
ambient temperature between 5°C and 40°C. A desiccant should be used in the control unit cabinets and 
other electrical components (in the event of extended storage change the desiccant regularly). Ven�late the 
area periodically. The floor should also be damp proof or damp-proof padding should be laid before storage.

Most parts of the machine are painted or coated to prevent rus�ng. However, some parts are exposed to the 
air and should be oiled or greased regularly for protec�on. Alterna�vely, spray the parts with oil and seal with 
plas�c coa�ng (in the event of extended storage check the parts regularly). Treat all exposed parts, pay 
par�cular aten�on to the conveyor rollers, the cylinder sha�s and the infeed and ou�eed storage.

All hoses and cables should be shielded by protec�ve covering to prevent damage.

Page 19/62 version 2.1 | 24-4-2024 
5 Infeed table 

The infeed table consists of sliders with arms to cut larger quan��es of the same profiles in quick succession.

Several profiles can be placed on the side load infeed table, which are straightened by the driven chains and 
arms. The sliders move one profile and place it on the bogies. Once over the bogies, the sliders lower, leaving 
the profile on the bogies, retrac�ng the arms and return to their home posi�on.

The conveyor can be controlled from the touch screen on the remote control, either in the material handling 
screen by selec�ng the conveyor or in the diagnos�cs screen under the conveyor tab.

Slider and Arm Star�ng posi�on: Infeed table is homed and arms are up.

Load profiles approximately 4 inches (10 cm) apart.

Press Infeed on the remote control: chains with 
material will move toward the arm.

The sliders will bring the profiles into a straight 
posi�on.

The sliders move the material above the bogies.

The bogies come up.

Arms rectract and sliders return to home. Profile ready for clamping.

6 Opera�on 

6.1 Before star�ng the machine, check that: 
• All persons are clear of the machine. 
• No maintenance work is being performed on the machine. 
• All fixed covers are in place. Some can be removed for cleaning, lubrica�on and maintenance. 
• The machine is free of jams and other obstacles. 

 
6.2 Star�ng up the machine 
The opera�on of the machine is divided into 4 phases: 

In order use the machine for profiling the operator must go through these 4 phases from le� to right. The 
machine starts up automa�cally. If an ac�on is required, the machine will show this, with addi�onal 
instruc�ons, if needed. The buton at the botom center of the screen is always the next step. It’s appearance 
will change accordingly to the state of the machine. The user interface will only display butons that are 
allowed to be clicked in that specific state to prevent confusion.

All 4 phases are described below and the steps that need to be taken are divided into 2 types. 
1. Manual (M), an ac�on is required from the operator (Orange). 
2. Automa�c (A), the machine performs this ac�on automa�cally (Blue).

NOTE! The images used to visualize the user interface do not show the whole func�onality of the interface 
and are primarily used as a guideline. Always assume that the given descrip�on below describes the ac�ons 
that need to be taken.

6.2.1 Powering on mode 
In ‘powering on mode’ the machine connects to the mo�on controller and perform several configura�on 
checks on both hard- and so�ware level to assure correct opera�on.

RoboRail Operator’s manual 

 
Page 22/62 version 2.1 | 24-4- 2024 
6.2.2 Homing mode 
In homing mode the machine is calibrated. The steps that need to be performed when the machine has had a 
complete power-down differ from the steps that need to be performed when the machine has been running 
in idle. 

 

* Visually monitor the arm because the movement is unsafe and is not restricted in the way in which it moves 
to its position. 
** When the machine has not had complete power-down and it has already been homed, the homing 
steps are skipped automatically. 
*** Use the move, rotate, open and close buttons on the right of the screen to remove previous materials.

RoboRail Operator’s manual 

 
Page 23/62 version 2.1 | 24-4- 2024 
6.2.3 Preparing mode 
In preparing mode the machine calculates the cu�ng file. The machine sets the bogies to the appropriate 
height and the operator places the material on the bogies. The operator is also responsible for preparing the 
roller yaws. Another op�on is to eject the remnant when the operator wants to use a different material or 
just clear the machine from the material of the previous job. This is possible via the ‘Eject remnant’ buton.

RoboRail Operator’s manual 

 
Page 24/62 version 2.1 | 24-4- 2024 

* When a material is used which uses the same 
bogie height, this step is skipped to save �me. 
** Make sure the material is always placed on the 
front bogie. 
*** The material should be moved to a posi�on 
where it meets the (imaginary) red line in the 
image below.

Page 25/62 version 2.1 | 24-4-2024 
6.2.4 Profiling mode 
In profiling mode the machine is ready to start profiling. The operator can select between automatic and 
(semi) automatic profiling and step mode and is able to select different cuts.

WARNING!

CRUSHING, WEDGING, BURNING HAZARD 
Cell, Ou�eed table 
Heavy and hot parts can fall onto the infeed table or the 
floor during the final cut and injure. The ou�eed table might 
move into the cell to catch a part and slides back again. Do 
not approach the table while the machine is s�ll cu�ng.

Provide a non-flammable container to catch the parts. Wait 
un�l parts have cooled down. These may be hot and sharp.

Wear the advised PPE.

WARNING!

FIRE HAZARD

all cuts. Operator only clicks ‘finish profiling’ on the botom centre of the screen a�er profiling is 
finished. 
• Semi-automa�c mode, perform the preparing, approaching, profiling and retrac�ng steps for one cut 
at a �me. Operator clicks ‘next cut’ a�er each cut and ‘finish profiling’ once all cuts are finished. 
• Step mode, operator must press ‘next step’ a�er preparing, approaching, profiling and retrac�ng. 
• Select cut, allows the operator to select a specific cut in the lists of cuts visible in the middle of the 
screen. 
• Finish profiling takes the operator back to preparing mode. 
• Move cut, allows the operator to manually change the torch posi�on . 
• Move material, allows the operator to move the material forward or backward and to retract the 
robot arm. 
• Open ou�eed table dialog, allows the operator to �lt, raise, retract and extend the ou�eed table

7 Conver�ng to a different profile 

 
Clamp your profiles using the appropriate accessories for the front chuck and rear chuck (trolley) mounted in 
the correct position. Tube and box sections can be clamped from the inside or from the outside.

Operation conveyor mode check 

When cutting angle, channel, flatbar you must cut in conveyor mode. When preparing the machine, a check 
will be performed on the loaded file. If it is one of these materials, the machine checks if the conveyor mode 
plate is present and if the outfeed table is at its highest position.

If it is not, the machine will ask to place the plate and to raise the table.

When loading a file with tube/square tube, the check will ask you to remove the plate and send the table 
down.

If you raise the table itself again with a tube/square tube and then go to cut a larger profile, the table will be 
sent down again so that you can't bump into the table with the material.

8 Inspec�on, tes�ng and maintenance 

8.1 Introduc�on 
Turn the power “off” when maintenance is being carried out so that nobody can get caught between moving 
machine parts.

WARNING!

CRUSHING, WEDGING HAZARD 
Infeed table, trolley, bogies, chuck 
If you are going to do maintenance turn off the machine so 
that no one is injured by moving machine parts.

WARNING!

CRUSHING, WEDGING HAZARD 
Never open the door or enter the cell during cutting!

Maintenance mode is ONLY for maintenance, calibration 
and trouble-shooting purposes! Do not enter the cell during 
cutting, you could be hit by the moving robot, exposed to 
heat, UV radiation, fumes, sparks, noise and possibly, laser 
radiation. You could be drawn in by the conveyor rollers or 
wedged between the clamps.

CAUTION!

ELECTRICAL HAZARD 
MACHINE PARTS MAY BE LIVE 
Maintenance only by qualified personnel as described in this 
manual.

CAUTION!

BURNING HAZARD 
HOT MATERIAL, COMPONENTS, PARTS OR SCRAP 
The plasma process generates high temperatures.

Components of the machine can be very hot. Give 
components of the machine time to cool down before 
touching them. Always wear boots and fireproof gloves. 

8.2 Cleaning and lubrica�on 
Make sure cleaning and lubrication is done according to the schedule supplied. It is important to clean 
the inside of the cell regularly, a buildup of dust and debris will reduce the life-span of some components 
and may compromise cutting quality. 

8.3 Replacing or changing plasma torch parts 

 

!

ATTENTION!

Consult the plasma unit instruction manual for information 
about changing plasma consumables.

RoboRail Operator’s manual 

 
Page 38/62 version 2.1 | 24-4-2024 
• Make sure the Plasma unit power is OFF before changing consumables. 
• Use the provided tools when replacing torch parts. 
• Do not tighten parts excessively, they will be heated during cutting, expand and become tighter, 
making them difficult to remove. 
• When plasma cutting with oxygen it is important to keep the consumable free from grease and oil.

Always wear gloves when replacing these consumables, the oils in your skin may cause damage to 
the consumables or the torch! 
8.4 Preven�ve Maintenance 

Periodic maintenance is necessary to ensure the reliability and safe operation of the machine. It is very 
important to keep the machine in perfect condition to: 
• maintain the high quality of the cutting work 
• have a minimum of down time 
• work safely with the machine 

The machine has to be cleaned and greased according the periodic grease schedule, in the case of 
intensive operation according to the number of operating hours.

Plasma Unit and optional Dust collector must be maintained according to the operator’s manual.

9.2 Alignment calibra�on of the chucks 

Calibration of the chucks makes sure that the front and rear chucks are aligned with each other. If they are 
not aligned, it can have a negative effect on the cutting quality.

The RoboRail is supplied with a tube (L = 2 m, 120 x 120 mm*) as reference part. If this tube is not available 
anymore, you must take an alternative square tube – with very accurate dimensions – that you use as a 
reference part.

Dimensions of the alternative tube: min. 120 x 120 mm | max. 200 x 200 mm* 

* For USA : 
- dimensions of the reference tube are L = 7 ft, 4 x 8”, thickness = ⅛” 
- dimensions of an alternative tube must be min. min. 5 x 5” / max. 8 x 8”
