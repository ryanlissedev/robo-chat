In that case you need another tool.\n\nWrench 24 \n\n \nTo align the chucks, do the procedure that follows: \nThe cover of the trolley is attached with 2x3 Allen screws with washers at the front (left + right) and 2x3 at the \nback (left + right) ( Image 1). \n▪ Loosen the Allen screws (12 pcs) with the Allen key. \n▪ Remove the cover of the trolley.\n\nThe rear chuck is attached with 2 bolts at both sides of the trolley. These are the bolts on the black plate \n( Image 2). \n▪ Loosen the 4 bolts slightly with the wrench. Make sure not to turn the bolts out too far. \n➢ This makes it possible to move the rear chuck manually. \n▪ Inspect the alignment of the front and rear chuck visually. \n▪ Slightly move the rear chuck to get it aligned with the front chuck.\n\nThe preferred movement is to slide the rear chuck horizontally. If you must turn the chuck to align it, make \nsure not to twist the chucks relative to each other to avoid distortion of the material. Turn the chuck carefully \nand only if necessary. \n\n▪ Make sure that the distance between the black plate and the orange material is equal over the entire \nlength of the plate ( Image 3). This applies to the black plate on both sides of the trolley. \n▪ Use the switch [Y+] on the control panel of the trolley (or the arrow button  on the screen) to move \nthe trolley fully forward. \n▪ Keep an eye on the Laser value on the screen and move the trolley to the rear with switch [Y‒] (or the \narrow button  on the screen). Make sure that the laser beam continues to hit the material.\n\nIf the laser value increases: \n▪ Move the rear chuck slightly to the left to align it with the front chuck. \n▪ Inspect the alignment of the front and rear chuck visually.\n\nIf the laser value decreases: \n▪ Move the rear chuck slightly to the right to align it with the front chuck. \n▪ Inspect the alignment of the front and rear chuck visually.\n\nFAQ RoboRail \nCalibration \n\nPage 2/2 version 0.0 | 8-4-2024 \n\nSubsequently: \n▪ If necessary/desired: do the steps to move the trolley forward and rearward again and make sure that \nthe Laser value on the screen remains below 2 (mm). \n▪ Tighten the bolts (2x2 pcs) to attach the rear chuck to the trolley. \n▪ Install the cover of the trolley with the Allen screws and washers. \n▪ Select Return to home on the screen.\n\nImage 1 One set of 3 Allen \nscrews (total 12) \nImage 2 Bolts below the chuck (2 sides) Image 3 Equal distance between the black \nplate and the orange material",
