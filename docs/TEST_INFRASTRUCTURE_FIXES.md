# Test Infrastructure Fixes - Resolved Hanging Issues

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Makefile `test-all` Command Hanging
**Problem**: The Makefile `test-all` command was using `npm test -- --coverage --run` which created conflicting arguments.
**Solution**: Changed to use `npm run test:coverage:ci` which is the proper coverage script defined in package.json.

### 2. ✅ Complex Vitest Configuration Causing Hangs
**Problem**: The main vitest.config.ts had multiple complex configurations with conditional logic, extensive thread pooling, and complex isolation setup.
**Solution**: Simplified to a single, reliable configuration with:
- Single test config function instead of multiple configs
- Simplified thread pool settings
- Reliable happy-dom environment
- Proper test type detection via environment variables

### 3. ✅ Overly Complex Test Setup and Isolation
**Problem**: The test setup file had extensive isolation hooks with complex cleanup logic including:
- Complex timer cleanup loops
- Global state manipulation
- Heavy DOM manipulation
- Module reset chains
**Solution**: Simplified to basic cleanup in beforeEach/afterEach:
- Basic mock clearing
- Simple DOM reset
- React Testing Library cleanup only

### 4. ✅ Conflicting Configuration Files
**Problem**: Multiple vitest config files (vitest.config.ts and vitest.config.minimal.ts) could cause confusion.
**Solution**: Removed the minimal config and consolidated everything into the main config.

### 5. ✅ Mixed Test Runner Setup
**Problem**: Package.json contained references to both Jest and Vitest patterns.
**Solution**: Ensured all test scripts use Vitest consistently and removed any Jest-specific configurations.

## Test Commands Now Working

All test commands now complete without hanging:

- `npm test` - Runs Vitest in watch mode
- `npm run test:run` - Runs all tests once
- `npm run test:unit` - Runs unit tests only
- `npm run test:integration` - Runs integration tests only
- `npm run test:coverage:ci` - Runs tests with coverage for CI
- `make test` - Makefile test command
- `make test-all` - Makefile test with coverage

## Key Configuration Changes

### vitest.config.ts
- Simplified from multiple complex configs to single adaptive config
- Uses happy-dom for better performance and reliability
- Proper thread pool configuration without excessive isolation
- Simplified coverage and reporter settings

### tests/setup.ts
- Removed complex test isolation import
- Simplified beforeEach/afterEach hooks
- Removed problematic timer cleanup loops
- Kept essential mocking and React cleanup only

### Makefile
- Fixed `test-all` command to use proper coverage script
- Updated `test` command to use `test:run` for consistency

## Performance Improvements

- Tests now start and complete quickly without hanging
- Simplified configuration reduces startup overhead
- Happy-dom provides faster DOM environment than jsdom
- Proper thread management prevents resource conflicts
- Reduced cleanup overhead in test hooks

## Test Infrastructure Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The test suite no longer hangs and all test commands work reliably. While individual tests may fail due to content issues, the test infrastructure itself is now stable and functional.
