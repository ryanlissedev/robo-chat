# Implementation Plan

- [-] 1. Fix OpenAI vector store API usage in retrieval system
  - Replace incorrect `openai.vectorStores.search()` calls with proper AI SDK file search integration
  - Update `enhancedRetrieval` function to use AI SDK's built-in file search capabilities
  - Remove custom vector store search implementation in favor of AI SDK approach
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Re-enable and fix file search tool in chat API
  - Remove the "Temporarily disable file search tool" comment and code in `/app/api/chat/route.ts`
  - Implement proper AI SDK file search configuration using `experimental_toolResources`
  - Add vector store ID management for file search operations
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 3. Implement vector store management utilities
  - Create `getOrCreateDefaultVectorStore` function to ensure vector store availability
  - Add proper error handling for vector store creation and access
  - Implement vector store listing and selection logic
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 4. Update model configuration for file search integration
  - Modify `openproviders` function to support file search configuration
  - Add `experimental_toolResources` parameter handling in model creation
  - Update OpenAI model configurations to support file search parameters
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Add comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - Implement graceful degradation when vector stores are unavailable
  - Add proper error logging for file search operations
  - Create fallback to regular chat when file search fails
  - Update error messages to be user-friendly and actionable
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Remove obsolete file search tool implementation
  - Clean up the custom `fileSearchTool` in `/lib/tools/file-search.ts`
  - Remove manual vector store search logic that's now handled by AI SDK
  - Keep utility functions for vector store creation and file upload
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Update chat business logic for file search integration
  - Modify chat submission scenarios to handle file search configuration
  - Update request options to include vector store information
  - Ensure file search is always enabled as per requirements
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 2.1_

- [ ] 8. Test chat responses with different AI models
  - Verify GPT-4o-mini works with file search enabled
  - Test GPT-5 models with file search integration
  - Ensure other providers (Claude, Gemini) continue to work without file search
  - Validate error handling for models that don't support file search
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 9. Test file upload and vector store operations
  - Verify PDF and document upload creates proper vector stores
  - Test vector store chunking and indexing
  - Validate file search retrieval returns relevant results
  - Test error scenarios for file upload failures
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 10. Add integration tests for complete chat and file search workflow
  - Create test for uploading documents and asking questions
  - Test chat responses include relevant document context
  - Verify fallback behavior when file search is unavailable
  - Test error scenarios and user experience
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 11. Update configuration and environment setup
  - Ensure OpenAI API key configuration supports file search operations
  - Update system prompts to work effectively with file search context
  - Verify vector store permissions and access controls
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 12. Optimize file search performance and user experience
  - Implement proper loading states for file search operations
  - Add user feedback for document processing and indexing
  - Optimize chunking strategies for better retrieval accuracy
  - Add monitoring and logging for file search performance
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 5.1_
