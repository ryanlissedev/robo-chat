# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The RoboRail Assistant application needs to ensure that chat responses are working properly and that file search functionality through OpenAI vector stores is operational. Currently, the file search tool is disabled and there are potential issues with the vector store search implementation that need to be resolved.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive real chat responses from AI models, so that I can get assistance with RoboRail-related questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL return a proper AI-generated response
2. WHEN a user selects different AI models THEN the system SHALL use the correct model for generating responses
3. WHEN there are API key issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages guiding users to settings
4. WHEN the chat is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through uploaded RoboRail documentation using file search, so that I can get contextually relevant answers based on the technical manuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file search is enabled THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI vector stores to search through uploaded documents
2. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant document chunks from the vector store
3. WHEN no relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest uploading more documents
4. WHEN vector store operations fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to regular chat without file search

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the file search tool to be properly integrated with the chat system, so that users can benefit from document-based responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat API receives a request with enableSearch=true THEN the system SHALL include the file search tool in the AI model configuration
2. WHEN the file search tool is called THEN the system SHALL use the correct OpenAI API endpoints for vector store operations
3. WHEN file search results are returned THEN the system SHALL format them properly for the AI model to use in responses
4. WHEN there are schema issues with the file search tool THEN the system SHALL resolve them without disabling the functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents to create or update vector stores, so that the file search functionality has relevant RoboRail documentation to search through.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads PDF, TXT, or other supported documents THEN the system SHALL process them and add to the vector store
2. WHEN creating a new vector store THEN the system SHALL use optimal chunking strategies for document retrieval
3. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on upload progress and success
4. WHEN vector store operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for chat and file search operations, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN vector store operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL log the specific operation and error details
3. WHEN users encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN file search is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to provide regular chat functionality
