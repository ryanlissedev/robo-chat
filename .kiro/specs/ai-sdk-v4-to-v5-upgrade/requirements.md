# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the upgrade of AI SDK from version 4 to version 5 across the entire codebase. The upgrade involves significant breaking changes including type system updates, streaming architecture changes, message structure modifications, and API method renames. The implementation will ensure all existing functionality continues to work while leveraging the new v5 capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade the AI SDK from v4 to v5, so that I can benefit from the latest features, improved performance, and better type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading packages THEN the system SHALL update all AI SDK packages to v5 versions
2. WHEN upgrading packages THEN the system SHALL update peer dependencies including zod to v3.25.0 or later
3. WHEN packages are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing functionality
4. WHEN packages are updated THEN the system SHALL not break any existing imports or exports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all type system changes to be properly migrated, so that TypeScript compilation continues to work without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating types THEN the system SHALL rename Message to UIMessage throughout the codebase
2. WHEN migrating types THEN the system SHALL rename CoreMessage to ModelMessage where applicable
3. WHEN migrating types THEN the system SHALL update convertToCoreMessages to convertToModelMessages
4. WHEN migrating types THEN the system SHALL update all message content properties to use parts array structure
5. WHEN migrating types THEN the system SHALL update all tool-related type references from args/result to input/output

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the useChat hook to be properly migrated to v5 architecture, so that chat functionality continues to work with the new transport system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating useChat THEN the system SHALL move from @ai-sdk/react import to ai/react import
2. WHEN migrating useChat THEN the system SHALL replace initialMessages with messages parameter
3. WHEN migrating useChat THEN the system SHALL implement transport architecture using DefaultChatTransport
4. WHEN migrating useChat THEN the system SHALL remove managed input state and implement manual input management
5. WHEN migrating useChat THEN the system SHALL replace append with sendMessage method
6. WHEN migrating useChat THEN the system SHALL replace reload with regenerate method

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all streaming functionality to be updated to v5 architecture, so that real-time responses continue to work with improved performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating streaming THEN the system SHALL update streamText to use new streaming patterns
2. WHEN migrating streaming THEN the system SHALL replace toDataStreamResponse with toUIMessageStreamResponse
3. WHEN migrating streaming THEN the system SHALL update stream protocol from proprietary to Server-Sent Events
4. WHEN migrating streaming THEN the system SHALL update all stream part handlers to use new chunk types
5. WHEN migrating streaming THEN the system SHALL update error handling from getErrorMessage to onError

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tool definitions and usage to be migrated to v5 format, so that tool calling functionality continues to work with improved type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating tools THEN the system SHALL rename parameters to inputSchema in tool definitions
2. WHEN migrating tools THEN the system SHALL update tool property references from args/result to input/output
3. WHEN migrating tools THEN the system SHALL update experimental_toToolResultContent to toModelOutput
4. WHEN migrating tools THEN the system SHALL remove toolCallStreaming option as it's now default
5. WHEN migrating tools THEN the system SHALL update tool UI part handling to use new state system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all provider-specific configurations to be updated, so that model integrations continue to work with v5 provider options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating providers THEN the system SHALL replace providerMetadata with providerOptions
2. WHEN migrating providers THEN the system SHALL update OpenAI configurations to remove deprecated options
3. WHEN migrating providers THEN the system SHALL update model settings to use new provider option structure
4. WHEN migrating providers THEN the system SHALL update embedding configurations to use providerOptions
5. WHEN migrating providers THEN the system SHALL update any provider-specific experimental flags

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the migration is successful, so that I can be confident the upgrade doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing API functionality
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation of changes made
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL include verification steps for manual testing
